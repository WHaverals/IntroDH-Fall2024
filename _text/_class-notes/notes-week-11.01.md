## formal description

Final Assignment (30%)

Your final assignment brings together the knowledge and skills you’ve acquired throughout this course, taking the form of a research proposal spanning 5 to 6 pages (approximately 2000 to 2500 words). Guided by a clear research question or 

your task is to devise a comprehensive plan for a data-intensive research project.

This plan should be guided by the following elements:

**Research Question and Hypothesis**: Articulate a central research question guiding your project and any hypotheses you aim to test or explore. This should form the foundation of your proposal and align closely with the dataset and methodologies you choose.

**Identification of a Datase**t: Clearly specify the dataset you will be using, along with the rationale for its selection. Outline your envisioned approach to data collection, along with the specific methods for manipulation, annotation, and classification of the data, including the anticipated impact of these processes.

**Methodology**: Describe the methodologies you will use to analyze the data, including the specific tools you will use and the anticipated impact of these tools on your research.

**Presentation and Dissemination**: Describe how you plan to disseminate your results and present your project both within academia and to a broader audience, considering aspects like copyright, preservation, and sustainability.

When writing up your research proposal, it’s important to translate these elements into a compelling and **cohesive narrative**. 

It isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about demonstrating your critical thinking skills and your ability to integrate and apply the various concepts and methodologies you’ve learned throughout this course. In other words, focus on articulating a clear research question and let your data handling and methodology reflect a nuanced understanding of the research process. Avoid falling into the trap of using jargon or clichéd phrases like “turbocharge [insert humanities subdiscipline here]”. Be nuanced. Be specific. Be critical. Be creative. For guidance on crafting DH research proposals, take inspiration from this blogpost by Quinn Dombrowksi.

I will be evaluating your proposal holistically. Rather than just looking for the inclusion of certain key elements (as in the Data Biography assignment before), I’m interested in how well you synthesize and present your ideas. The one area where I will be particularly quantitative is in your use of citations: make sure to include at least 6 references that support the disciplinary context of your proposal (your bibliography won’t count towards the final word count).

You will have the opportunity to present your research proposal in class on 25 April. This presentation will be followed by a Q&A session, where you will receive feedback from me and your peers– feedback that you can still incorporate into your final, written research proposal.

Please format your file as LastName-Research-Proposal and email it to me by 7 May 2024, which is Dean’s Date.

## some speculations about postcards

- a speculative project, half carried out, written out super fast with a few holes in the argument, but with a clear sense of what you want to do and why you want to do it. In other words, it is grounded in potential. Is it perfect, no. Is it a good starting point, yes. Am I tying together some of the things we've seen in class, yes.

### Research Question and Hypothesis

In this project, I will explore the Princeton Historical Postcard Collection to investigate the history of Princeton University through the lens of postcards.

I was wondering, hmm, what if i had access to a collection of postcards from princeton university, what could I do with them? I could explore the history of the university, the student body, and the surrounding community. I could look at the architecture of the campus, the student life, the campus events, the campus landscapes, and the campus traditions. 

I could explore the spatial distribution of the postcards and identify any patterns or trends in the data. I could create a heat map of the postcards, showing where they were sent from and where they were sent to. I could use the postcards to explore the social, cultural, and political history of the university. I could use the postcards to connect the past with the present, to create a bridge between the historical and the contemporary. I could use the postcards to tell a story about the university, to bring the past to life in a new and engaging way.

Postcards are a fascinating medium for historical research. They are a form of visual communication that can be used to explore the social, cultural, and political history of a particular time and place.

They can be considered the first form of social media, allowing people to share images and messages with friends and family across great distances.

Interestingly, University Campuses across the United States have a rich history of postcard production. These postcards can provide valuable insights into the history of the campus, the student body, and the surrounding community.

Campus Postcards can be used to explore a wide range of topics, including:
- Campus Architecture
- Student Life
- Campus Events
- Campus Traditions
  

This is the central research question that will guide my project: How can postcards be used to explore the history of Princeton University?

###  Identify a dataset you might explore

For my research, I found the Princeton Historical Postcard Collection to be a valuable resource. This collection contains over 500 postcards depicting Princeton University and the surrounding area.
It was collected by the univeristy itself. Most of them are from the early 20th century, but there are also postcards from the late 19th century and the mid-20th century.

Now, I was very lucky to find this collection. If Princeton wouldn't have had a colleciton like this, I would have had to look for postcards in other places. Some other place I could have looked for postcards are:

  - [NYPL Digital Collections](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/)
  - [Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections/)
  - [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/)

Autcion websites are another option: 
  - [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/)
  - [HipPostcard](https://www.hippostcard.com/)
  - [Delcampe](https://www.delcampe.net/)
  - 
    --> I don't own this data and I would have to ask for permission to use it, I want to make sure that I have the right to use the data for my research. I can collect it from the website, but I won't be able to redistribute it without permission. So in terms of sustainability, I would have to think about how to make sure that the data is available for future research.

If this option was also not feasible

    - There is a nice book: "Princeton: A Picture Postcard History of Princeton and Princeton University" by John Cunningham and Robert Craig. This book contains a large number of postcards depicting Princeton University and the surrounding area. I could use this book as a dataset for my research. This would be a time-consuming process, as I would have to scan each postcard individually and transcribe the text on the back of the postcard. However, it would allow me to create a dataset that is tailored to my research question.

    - There is a possibility to create my own dataset by scanning postcards from my own collection or from the collections of friends and family. This would be a time-consuming process, but it would allow me to create a dataset that is tailored to my research question.

What is interesting about the dataset?

Place, time, depictions

# after collecting the data

I want to collect the metadata for each postcard. This metadata will include 

- information about the date the postcard was sent (NA if not available)
- the location it was sent from (NA if not available)
- the location it was sent to (NA if not available)
- the place that is depicted on the postcard
- message
- a tag for the content of the postcard
  - campus architecture
  - student life
  - campus events
  - campus landscapes
  - campus traditions
  - other
  
# analyze

i will use leaflet, because i want to show the map of princeton and the postcards on the map. i want to create a heat map of the postcards, showing where they were sent from and where they were sent to. this will allow me to explore the spatial distribution of the postcards and identify any patterns or trends in the data.
