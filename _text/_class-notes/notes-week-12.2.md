# Season Finale

## some manifestations

het is onze laatste les samen!

Throughout our sessions, I've deliberately avoided defining DH too narrowly or seeking to pinpoint its essence. I believe that DH is a broad and diverse field, and it's particularly fascinating to observe how different scholars and practitioners interpret and fill this space.

That said, the DH Manifesto you read this week **does** attempt to articulate a sort of universal core of what DH represents. It's an interesting exercise to compare this more defined approach to the broader, more inclusive perspectives we've discussed. Today, I'd like us to reflect on this tension between the specific and the general, the defined and the expansive. How does the Manifesto’s vision align or conflict with your own views? How might these differing interpretations influence the future direction of the field?

dat gezegd, het DH manifesto dat jullie deze week hebben gelezen is wel een tekst die probeert om een soort universele kern te gaan van wat DH is.
