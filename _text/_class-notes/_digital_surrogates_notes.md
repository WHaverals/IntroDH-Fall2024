## Digital surrogate questions, considerations, and reflections (Wouter)

- how does the digital surrogate **compare** to the physical artifact? what might be lost or distorted in the process?
  
- what **metadata** is provided with the digital surrogate? is it sufficient to understand the artifact’s historical or cultural significance?
  
- how does digitization balance accessibility with preserving the artifact’s original **integrity**? any compromises visible?
  
- what impact does the **digitization technology** (e.g., scanning, 3d imaging) have on how we perceive and interact with the digital version?
  
- how does the **loss of material aspects** (e.g., paper, ink, binding) affect understanding of the artifact’s original use or significance?
  
- how does **interacting** with the digital version differ from handling the physical object? what features (e.g., zoom, search) enhance or detract from the experience?
  
- how does digitization affect the artifact's ability to be copied, shared, and circulated?
  
- what are the potential **impacts on scholarship** or public engagement?
  
- what **decisions** were made about what to digitize and how to present it? are any parts of the collection left out or emphasized, and why?
  
- how does digitization contribute to the **long-term preservation** of the artifact? are there concerns about the sustainability of digital formats and storage over time?

- how might relying on digital surrogates **change research** or scholarship? what types of analysis are made easier or harder by working with digital versions of primary sources?
