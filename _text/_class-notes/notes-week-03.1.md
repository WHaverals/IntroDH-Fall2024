We have Will with us today, from special collections.
Very glad to aacomodate us today, also on such short notice.
I'm going to give to floor to you to talk about what Special COllections is,  what considerations and how many condsiderations go into the digititzation process.

# Questions for discussion:

## Ethical Considerations in Digitization

How do ethical considerations shape the way we digitize and represent cultural artifacts? What responsibilities do institutions have to the cultures and communities whose artifacts they are digitizing?

## Physical vs. Digital Experience

In what ways does the experience of interacting with physical objects differ from their digital counterparts? What unique values and limitations are inherent in each form?

## Impact of Digitization on Cultural Heritage

How does digitization impact the preservation and transmission of cultural heritage? Can digitization both democratize and distort our understanding of cultural artifacts?

## Challenges in Digitization Process

What are some of the technical and logistical challenges faced in the digitization process? How do factors like color accuracy, cropping, and metadata influence the end result?

## Material Literacy in a Digital World

How does the digital environment affect our material literacy? What skills are necessary to critically engage with digital surrogates?

## The Role of Interfaces and User Experience

How do digital interfaces and user experience design impact our interaction with and understanding of digitized collections?

## Balancing Access and Ethical Representation

How can institutions balance the need to provide broad access to digitized collections with the need to ethically and accurately represent the cultures and histories those collections embody?

## Future of Digital Humanities

What is the future of digital humanities in light of the increasing digitization of cultural artifacts? How can we ensure that digitization supports rather than undermines the goals of humanities research?

## Representational Bias in Digitization

How does Western-centric bias manifest in digitization efforts, and what can be done to mitigate this?

## Legal and Privacy Concerns in Digitization

What are the legal and privacy concerns associated with digitizing personal or culturally sensitive materials, and how are these being addressed?

# Other aspects, more specific to the digitization of postcards
    - What are the challenges of digitizing
    - color
    - detail
    - cropping
    - metadata
    - interface
    - viewing in person
    - digitization process
    - ethical issues
    - material literacy
    - material literacy in the digital environment
    - what surrogate do
    - reflections on material literacy
    - against cleaning

# access to files?
    - data cleaning
    - trancribe the backs of the postcards
    - provide geographic information
    - build a map
    - add to the metadata

- Pleateuas people (Washington State University)
- Mukudu is a CMS that is designed to be used by indiginous communities to manage their own cultural heritage
- Mukudu: who gets to add to the collection? Who gets to see the collection? Who gets to use the collection?
- Cultural repatriation: only did the digitization because it was requested by the tribe

- Working on Digitization the Public Policy Papers at Princeo
- Association of American Indian Affairs Records, 1851-2016
- Partnership with Yale
- Arthur C. Warner Papers, 1927-2003

- How to decide what gets digitized?
    1. Request driven, 300 pages per year per user
    2. Heavy Research use/ historical value (e.g. cold war material)
    3. Inclusivity for a marginalized community

- Big projects go to a vendor, small projects are done in house
- Deal with GALE, ProQuest, and other vendors
- They have typically 7 years of rights to the digitized material
- Do they have control over the metadata?

- ARKs: Archival Resource Keys

- ca. 50 cents per page for digitization
- massively laborious process
- is digitization a good preservation tool?
    - sort of true
    - is there anything you came across already in your career that you wish was digitized -- but you were not able to digitize?
- decisions about environmental issues too -- storage farms

- minimal or iterative processing:
    - described in the "aggregate level" -- usually a box of material that is being described. Hozever, the metadata and the level to whcih we're describing is an issue.
    - you will have metadata at the folder level/ box levelm but not much more than that
    - Component ID -> the unique identifier for the item

- Privacy and copyrigh: 
    - Depends on the collection, restrictions mandated by the donor.
- Privacy concers:
    - Social security numbers in the papers of a politician for example

- "Sanitized" metadata
    - "Sanitized" metadata is metadata that has been stripped of any sensitive information. This is done to protect the privacy of individuals and to prevent the misuse of sensitive information. For example, if a collection contains the papers of a politician, the metadata might be sanitized to remove any social security numbers or other sensitive information.

- How do you maintain backups?
    - 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of the data, 2 on different media, 1 offsite
