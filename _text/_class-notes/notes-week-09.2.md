## This class


## return to flat earth

Last year, Netflix released a documentary about the Flat Earth Society, titled "Behind the Curve" [3]. This society argues that the Earth’s sphericity is not perceivable by humans, whose point of view cannot realize the planet’s sphericity. The government, for them, brewed a plot to keep citizens docile and ignorant [4].

Although science provides enough information to contradict them [5], the **Flat Earthers can be considered thought-provoking at least**. The fascination for them does not originate from eccentricity, but rather from the **audacity in questioning an assumption taken for granted**. This is something you have to give them credit for!

At school, children learn many truths such as human evolution or the Big Bang theory. But only over the years, they understand these theories in depth, developing a critical method to evaluate truthfulness.

Critical thinking is a valuable means to question every kind of knowledge and form an opinion. Sometimes it can be tortuous and tricky, especially in the scientific community [6]. It was the case for **Galileo Galilei who, in front of the Inquisition**, was forced to recite the abjuration about something that was empirically proven [7].

## origins of projection

To contradict the flat-Earth arguments, it can be said that **our planet’s sphericity was already known before the Common Era**. The first text of history on this subject comes from **Strabo**, a philosopher of Hellenistic Greece who lived between 64–63 BCE and 24 CE.

Strabo’s pupils were well aware of the planet’s sphericity; they had to know notions like equator and the tropics to attend his class [20]. Pupils were also used to studying large wooden globes of statuary dimensions. The need for moving these globes to share knowledge represents the origin of cartographic projection [21]. which Strabo dates back to the 2nd century BCE [20].

Round representations of the Earth go back to Ancient Greece, and the earliest spherical maps of the world were being created in the Islamic world in the 13th century or earlier. But none of those are thought to survive. Other than descriptions and flattened maps that would have covered earlier globes, the Erdapfel is the oldest remaining artifact of its kind.

- Erdapfel is a German word that means “earth apple” and is a term used to describe a globe. The Erdapfel is a terrestrial globe produced by Martin Behaim from 1490 to 1492. It is the oldest surviving terrestrial globe and is constructed of a laminated linen ball in two halves, reinforced with wood and overlaid with a map painted by Georg Glockendon. The globe displays the known world of the time, including the recently discovered Americas and the mythical islands of the Atlantic. The globe is housed in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, Germany.

- Hunt-Lenox Globe is a small metallic globe that is dated to the early 16th century. It is one of the oldest surviving globes of the Earth. The globe is engraved with the Latin phrase “Hic Sunt Dracones” which translates to “Here be dragons”. The globe is housed in the New York Public Library.

Maps, over time, were printed and drawn on papyrus, textiles, vellum, paper, plastic, etc. Today, however, they are mainly displayed on smartphones or personal computers in what was defined as a cartographic turn [22]. This digitalization modified the perception of territory, especially through zooming, a gesture that allows the reader to increase and decrease the point of view rapidly. 

But zooming is not a mere function, it connects worlds in two and three dimensions, **the map and the globe**. Maps’ two-dimensionality is thus connected to the globe’s three-dimensionality like in Google Earth, which merges different levels of detail through interaction [23].

The cartographic projection, indeed, has the **ability to flatten the globe without losing the space’s continuity**. If you consider the standard European world map, the distance between the USA and Japan is apparently misleading; but once that the viewer understands that the left side continues to the right one, everything is clearer.

The cartographic projection is one of the **most ambitious human gestures**. It embodies the gigantic effort to grasp and represent the volume of the Earth. 

The **advantages** that characterize the cartographic projections are **balanced by inconveniences**, as it happens in many processes of transformation. 

The major trouble is the **deformation of the distances between the nodes**, which is clearly visible in a very popular projection: The Mercator projection. It clearly shows a **deformation that is proportional to the distance from the equator**. The Mercator is one of the major projections as it maintains the correct proportion in numerous populated areas. However, the distortion of Norway is clearly noticeable compared to the grid as well as the false magnitude of Antarctica.

  - Still, the Mercator projection is the most used in the world, especially in the **navigation field** (aviation and sea travel, invaluable for plotting a course over long distances, maintains the correct angles between nodes). 

  - It is also the most used in the **digital world** (rectangular grid aligns well with the pixel grid of digital displays), where it is used by Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. 

## mapping in DH

To use maps effectively in a DH project, a few **practical and critical considerations** are essential. 

- Practical: From a practical point of view, clarifying the relationship between maps and research is essential. 
  
  - Is your project about the **effect of space, or distance** or is the map merely a **convenient way to show where something happened?** 
  
  - Is yours a **historical** project or a **contemporary** one? this will affect the kind of map you use.
  
  - **what kind of data** is available for your project and **to what extent does it lend itself** to spatial presentation?
- 
  - critical: **specific capacities of spatial analysis**. What is the **intellectual framework** for your project? Are there deeper implications of spatial analysis in your project? Considering how map choice affects research outcomes. What kind of knowledge do you gain, etc. 

Steps: 

The first step is to clarify **what the maps are being used for and why** in a project 

    this will inform the choice of tools/platforms for research (Sack 2017).

    and **what form the data will take**, since this will inform the choice of tools and platforms for research (Sack 2017).

As with all digital tools, those for mapping have matured considerably. They also range from quite simple platforms that can be used to make a map within a few minutes to extraordinarily complex programs that serve professional geographers working with spatial analysis of data. 


- Mapping tools clearly have a role to play in the study of **history, culture, literature, and community activism**, as will be clear from the examples discussed later.

## A story of tools

While mapping platforms vary in complexity, all make use of a base-map, data points, and labels. Many use layers, legends (those keys to symbols that indicate landmarks and other features), and customizable graphic elements. Most basic mapping tools have excellent tutorials. 

One place to begin is with **Leaflet**, though even using this relatively easy platform will likely require assistance at the outset. In addition well-designed lessons from within the digital humanities community provide an introduction to the vocabulary and range of practices in this area. 

Keep in mind that many mapping tools are not designed for web presentation, but for analysis and publication. Other platforms are entirely web-based and allow data to be uploaded and used on their sites (these are rarely private or secure, so that should be kept in mind).

### Exercise:

Compare QGIS, Leaflet, ArcGIS StoryMaps and carto. How are they different, how are they similar? What are their purposes, audiences? Start by looking at the documentation of both tools. The contrast between them is educational. 
  
- **ARCGIS** -- The Cadillac of mapping software -- is another popular platform, but it is not free. The Cadillac of mapping software, including online and desktop mapping tools. Requires a monthly subscription after a three week trial. Their smart‐mapping features make it relatively easy to create meaningful, high‐quality maps from large data sets. Automatic detection of city‐and‐state type information makes it easy to use whatever geo‐data your data comes in. The Living Atlas feature makes it simple to include map layers reflecting pre‐existing datasets such as age demographics, media income levels, poverty rates, elevation, wildfire hazard, soil erosion and myriad other factors. Can be shared as a map embedded in a web page with varying degrees of user controls. Tooltips may include any or all of the information in a table row, as well as charts generated from that information.
    
- This **QGIS** (Quantum GIS) tutorial from finding, downloading, and installing, to use and print is clear and easy to follow: https://gisgeography.com/how-to-make-a-map-gis-free/ **QGIS** begins with data. Its features are designed with attention to the analytic functionality of its platform, leading with data types and formats specific to geospatial information work. Free, open‐source desktop software (Win, MacOS, Linux) ‐ high‐powered GIS software akin to the desktop version of ArcGIS, but not the simplicity of the web‐based smart‐mapping ArcGIS. This will have a steeper learning curve. There are no built‐in base maps, but can include open maps from the internet (including Google and other sources), and a simple plugin makes it easy to import historical base maps. There are quite a lot of YouTube tutorials for specific operations. Although some of the base‐level functionality can be limited, there are a lot of plugins to extend the functionality. For example, the program does not natively export dynamic content for the web, but the qgis2web plugin allows you to export maps as web dynamic web‐pages, though they are not as slick as the ArcGIS Online maps.

- **Leaflet** is another popular, easy-to-use, platform and also has its own tutorials: https://leafletjs.com/ **Leaflet** focuses on the graphical components and research behaviors they support: maps, layers, controls, and graphical features and utilities. Leaflet assumes you want to make a map and show things on it. Either can be used to show information that is specific to geographical data. 

No matter what platform or tool is used, a few elements will be common to all: 

- selection of a base map, the possibility of layers to selectively contain information, 
- a way to create or use symbols and define them in a legend, 
- and methods of displaying and working with data in an appropriate format.
- all mapping tools will require that data contain geographical coordinates (Gregory, Donaldson, and Hardie 2018). 
  
The only exception to this is if a map is simply being used as a picture (in which case, geospatial information tools are not needed; symbols, annotation, and other elements can simply be added as they would be to any other image).

## Conceptualizing a mapping project

The **conceptual work of a project drives the decisions about tools**! Having an understanding of the specific capacities of spatial analysis will expand the possibilities of the research. 

But the platforms just mentioned, and other GIS tools, were developed to support spatial data and its analysis and display. Grasping what this means will set the intellectual framework for a project. 

A map can be made in minutes in Google Maps without prior experience, but **the challenge is to understand why a map is useful**. 

The list that follows describes ways in which maps are used in humanities research. It is not exhaustive, but it provides a starting point for thinking through different aspects of the use of maps. The purpose of using a map in the project might be to:

* **Show** something on a map

    To show something on a map consider **what will be shown and what map is appropriate**. The ease of using Google Maps makes the web application attractive. But even in the most basic mapping project, questions about the kind of map are significant. Does it show roads and transportation networks or physical features of the landscape? Are administrative borders and boundaries marked, cities and towns, or elevation and other topographical details? Is it a historical map or a recent one? Many more such questions can be asked since maps are often designed for particular purposes and needs.

    _Example_: Imagine creating an interactive web map that displays the locations of ancient Greek temples across the Mediterranean region. Each temple icon on the map could provide additional information about its architecture, historical significance, and the deity it was dedicated to. Users can explore the spatial distribution of these temples and understand their cultural context.
    https://www.ancient-greece.org/map.html 

    _Example_: NJ Shipwrecks. 

* **Analyze** an aspect of spatial experience. 

    Questions about how far things are from each other, how long it takes to move between them, what natural and social features exist to define a region or locale, and how space factors into patterns of culture all raise issues specific to spatial experience. These intersect with matters such as accessibility, transportation, isolation, communication, and development patterns, as well as the values of land and location in relation to status, class, value, and symbolic issues (myth and ritual). Separating those features of research that are actually spatial from those that are incidentally related to space by location is crucial. Where something is might not be a spatial issue—but how long it takes to get there might be.

    _Example_: [Mapping Past Societies](https://harvard-cga.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=9e7b4e361f5940d5bd399ec6c2ca2197) Many DH projects focus on historical contexts. For instance, scholars create interactive maps that visualize historical events, migrations, or urban development over time. What patterns show up when you juxtapose cultural, environmental and economic data in this way? What connections do you see?



* **Narrate** an event using a map or maps to present the argument. 
  
    Many historical events take place in space or in locations—battles, conquests, and struggles over territory, but also disease, development, and transformations of infrastructure. These can be shown and narrated using maps. Again the question is whether the map merely provides a reference frame (this is where something took place) or whether the location had an active role in the events (the spatial features of the location played a part in what occurred: think of the scholar scenario in Chapter 1 focused on the Caribbean island slave rebellion). If the location played a role, then is a flat map adequate to show how the physical features of the place factored into the event?

    Example: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/A-Cutting-Edge-Second-Look-at-the-Battle-of-Gettysburg-1-180947921/?no-ist=
    Gettysburg map

    Digital Samos: https://digitalsamos.udc.es/interactive_map.html

* **Interpret** a map as a historical and critical form. 
  
  A map can be an object of research in its own right. How does it present an understanding of a territory? Through what means was it constructed? It might contain vivid graphical features in iconographic form, showing houses, streets, churches, graveyards, and roads that no longer exist. It may contain mythical and symbolic images—sea monsters, dragons, or outsized renderings of other flora and fauna. For humanities scholars, these features are important aspects of the map’s identity and information. Place names also contain historical information, and the extraction of this information from a historical map might be crucial for studying language, cultural issues, and other matters in addition to the geographical details of a place.

  Example: Consider analyzing a 16th-century world map created by Gerardus Mercator. By examining the map’s projection, cartographic choices, and biases, you can uncover insights about the worldview of that era. Mercator’s map, while influential, distorted the size of landmasses, favoring Europe. Interpreting it critically allows us to understand how cartographers shaped perceptions of the world based on cultural, political, and religious factors.

* **Create** a map from place-based references. 

    Many literary works and primary documents contain references to places. These may or may not correspond to actual or once existing places, but culling these from a work to create a map of the narrative can create an image of a place from references. Rather than using a map as a pre-existing structure in which to place events, this process allows a location to emerge from geographical references. Finding ways to express knowledge embodied in a text allows literary and literal aspects of geography to complement each other.

## GIS

All digital mapping projects that use spatial data rely on GIS (Geographic Information Systems) platforms to create their argument, analysis, and/or presentations.

As noted above, the acronym GIS stands for **Geographic Information Systems**. These systems are designed to integrate maps with data for analysis and presentation. GIS systems were not developed for the humanities, but to map natural and social phenomena. Humanists have adopted these tools and platforms for research about places and spatial experience.

GIS systems embody certain positivist assumptions that privilege physical reality over social and cultural experience (Pickles n.d.)! Humanists have adopted these tools and platforms for research about places and spatial experience. Humanists also study maps as cultural artifacts, interpreting their representation of spatial and geographical phenomena. 
    
Early maps of exploration, for instance, tend to favor detail about coastline features, rather than knowledge of a landmass’s interior, while Indigenous mapping may have very little information about coasts and borders and focus instead on pathways and ritual sites. **GIS systems were not made to accommodate the rhetorical specifics of many of these maps or the spatial experience they record.**

### Georectification and georeferencing 

Since many historical and non-standard maps were not made according to a specific standard system, they must be assigned spatial coordinates to be useful. This process is called **georectification**. 

Take the example of a handdrawn map given to you by a friend to guide your driving route to their house. Now consider putting it into digital form so it can also be matched to a map application on your phone. Similar issues arise with maps of early explorers finding the New World that need to be matched to modern latitude and longitude coordinates. Problems will arise that require decisions about how to proceed with fitting one system to another. Even maps that have coordinate systems need to be “referenced” to a particular standard so that the coordinates are legible within the digital environment. This process is called georeferencing. Other adjustments to maps allow shapes and distortions to be “corrected” and aligned with different coordinate systems.

### Geocoding information 

Another common task in translating textual material to maps is that of **finding coordinates for named locations**. Suppose you have a long list of place names, perhaps the homes of authors, or sites on a pilgrimage, or locations in a novel, or a collection of letters. The most common way of placing these on a map using a digital application is to assign them **longitude and latitude** values. This **can be done automatically using geocoding web services** that assign coordinates. Such automated work (Google Maps has one such service) always needs to be checked. In spite of the sophistication of the libraries that check place names and assess the probability of their occurrence, locations can end up in odd places. If something looks odd, it may well be wrong.

### Raster vs. vector

In GIS (Geographic Information Systems), geographical data is represented using two main types of images: vector and raster.

Vector images consist of points, lines, and polygons, which represent specific geographic elements like roads, rivers, and city boundaries. These elements are defined by exact coordinates and maintain their clarity regardless of scale changes. Vector data is perfect for detailed, precise mapping of distinct features.

Raster images are made up of a grid of pixels, where each pixel carries a color and value, representing an area on the ground. This format is ideal for showing continuous data such as elevation or temperature. Raster images can lose clarity when scaled up, as pixels become more visible.

Representation: Vector uses shapes for precise locations; raster uses pixels for area-based data.
Scalability: Vector images remain clear at any size; raster images may blur when enlarged.
Usage: Vector is used for accurate mapping of specific features; raster is chosen for broad phenomena like weather patterns.
Example: For city mapping, vector data would outline streets and buildings with sharp accuracy. Raster data might provide a satellite backdrop, offering visual context but becoming pixelated if zoomed in too closely.

### Visual formats and data types 

Shape files and pixel images are two ways of creating and storing information for mapping. (These distinctions hold true in other visualizations as well, as per Section 6a.) Shape files carry geospatial vector data. That allows the specific descriptions of geographical area to be mapped and also transferred from one GIS platform to another. These are vector-based files, which can be readily scaled and resized without losing their shape. Pixel based images are like tapestries, they record color and value, but they do not identify shapes. They may be given coordinate data, but that requires georeferencing. Each has advantages. Pixel-based images work well for maps that are being used as images, as historical references, or for presentation of information layered onto a base map. These do not require the areas of the map be analyzed as shapes since they will not be manipulated independently. For work that requires analysis or modeling, vector-based graphics are essential. The graphical format will play a role in how it can be altered. For changing shape and area, shape files are the best. For merely attaching coordinates to the map as an image, the pixelbased or “raster” format is fine. These two formats will be discussed again below.

The data used in mapping generally defines points, lines, or areas. Again, a pixel-based image can readily position a point or line within the axes of its implied grid, just as if it were putting a marker on a tic-tac-toe board. But the calculation of area—particularly features of boundaries and edgesmight be better achieved with a vector graphic. A pixel-image can work like a jigsaw puzzle piece and be as complex in form as it needs to be, but it cannot be manipulated as a shape, just copied, pasted, and moved.

Maps have their own graphic logic and conventions. For instance, administrative boundaries are often used to display demographic information linked to populations. But when the results of opinion polls are mapped, should they be displayed by coloring the entire area inside the boundaries of the counties or nations, by points showing distribution, or in a shape proportional to the percentages? The term chloropleth refers to those maps in which entire areas are given a color value (counties, states, countries) to show thematic information aggregated by region. In some cases, this may make sense, as when a candidate wins an election and wins a state. But in mapping consumer preferences, perhaps more precise counts and locations are significant. If you are trying to track an epidemic, then transportation networks as well as population centers and points of contact are important. Natural phenomena (insect invasions, weather, migratory patterns, etc.) do not regard national boundaries, but are regularly presented on maps that mark these strongly—sometimes even cutting countries out from continents. Because area is a feature of geography, its connection to data should be correlated closely. When area is made to represent quantity (size of population in a city) as well as geography (the size of a region), this becomes confusing since the graphical value is being used in two different ways.

### Datatypes: CSV, GeoJSON, and KML

The easiest, simplest way to store geographical coordinate information is in a spread sheet, exported as. csv. Place name, latitude, and longitude are the basics of geospatial data. A standard format for geospatial information is KML, Keyhole Markup Language. As a markup language, and a flavor of XML, it has the advantage of being highly descriptive, domain specific, and being a broadly adopted standard. However, given the popularity of JSON for storing data, the development of GeoJSON comes as no surprise. Like KML, GeoJSON is relatively user-friendly, which is to say, human readable, in its formal syntax and expressions.

## A note about cartography 

The field of cartography possesses critical and technical expertise in mapping. It has a long history, stretching to Egyptian and Babylonian mapmakers several millennia before the Common Era. The principle that unites the earliest mapmaking with cartographic practices in the present is the recognition that all maps are projections. The mapping of any section of the round globe of the earth onto a two-dimensional surface always results in distortion of one factor among several: distance, area, or shape. The study of cartographic conventions and their history is a field unto itself. But having some basic understanding of the implications of projection systemshow they distort—is helpful in thinking about maps from the most esoteric historical primary source to the banal but still problematic Google Maps application. 

Maps are considered conformal if they preserve the shape of landmasses and water areas. This will always depend on the point of view from which the map is made. Different projections preserve shapes better at various latitudes. Some maps distort area to preserve other features: the Mercator projection, invented in the 16th century but still the basis of many maps, is created on a grid of lines that align with compass directions (true north, south etc.). In Mercator maps, the sizes of northern hemisphere land masses are particularly exaggerated. Other more recent innovations, such as cylindrical projection (invented in the 1960s by Arthur H. Robinson) have been invented to correct for various distortions. 

Consider the features of Google Earth (satellite images)—that they show every area of the earth in daylight. Even in the satellite view of the earth, country boundaries are indicated as light lines imposed on the landmasses.1 The photographic realism of the rendering suggests that we are looking at the world and not at a representation of it, but those lines don’t exist on the earth. The omniscient view is also problematic. Google Maps, by contrast, is meant to provide support for navigation, travel directions, and daily use. It allows instant views of any place as if they were all equally accessible (Madrigal 2012). Google Maps is constantly being updated, which means that information about the built environment (street views, routes, etc.) is always being surveilled by Google. 

Like all human artifacts, maps contain assumptions that embody cultural values. Even their orientation can have a symbolic value. For instance, maps common in the European Middle Ages positioned the known continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe with Jerusalem at their center. When we take a map of 17th century London or 5th century Rome, or an Aboriginal map drawing, and try to reconcile it to a digital map using standards that are part of our contemporary geographical coordinate system, we are making a profound, even violent, intervention in the worldview of the original. Whether we are working with materials in the present and forcing them into a single geographical representation system, or using materials from the inventory of past presentations in map formats, we are always in the situation of taking one already interpreted version of the world and pushing it into yet another interpretative framework.

In western conventions, most maps portray the earth with the northern hemisphere at the top. Nothing in the physical world requires this to be the case. The earth turns on its axis, but this motion could be observed just as surely with the south pole at the top. Conventions become so naturalized that their ideological impact disappears. Researching map conventions provides insight into cultural differences and conceptions of space and geography. One of the challenges for humanists is to shift the perspective from that of omniscience—a viewpoint from a neutral outside position—to one of experience, situated within the conditions of lived persons.

## Space and place 

In environmental studies, a contrast is made between concepts of “space” as a physical environment and “place” as an experiential one. In addition, in the work of Edward Soja and others, the concept of space as an “artifact” or construction has arisen out of the already mentioned approach to “non-representational” geography (Blake 2001). In this approach, space is a construct, not a given, and comes into being through the activities of experience. These are not concepts that have found their way into digital projects to any large degree, and they pose challenges for the visual tools of mapping that we have at our disposal at present. However, the notion of space as an artifact versus that of space as a “given” that can be represented is profoundly important for humanistic work, even if the mapping platforms that come from more empirical sciences do not accommodate its principles.

One example of this constructed approach is the TubeMap made by Tom Carden (n.d.). Based on the famous schematic map of the London Underground, Carden’s map distorts the length of each individual route to reflect the amount of time it takes to go from one point to another within the system. This is a finely defined project, and makes its point dramatically in the visual presentation.

Recent work on the relations between race and spatial experience address these issues more radically, building on the understanding of spatial constructed-ness as rooted in individual experience (Shabazz 2015). Work at the cutting edge of such research grapples with ways to codify and structure data on topics of race (Teixara and Zubieri 2016). What constitutes the markers of racism, white supremacy, legacies of oppression, and how are they to be shown and seen in maps? How do settler maps erase Indigenous knowledge (Vélez 2017)?


## Criteria


Maps are used most effectively when several crucial criteria are considered in the conceptualization and implementation of a project. These include choosing the right base map for the data and thinking about how the interpretation will be codified and presented. Including primary documents, narration, and interpretative frameworks guides the viewer through the argument, but allowing direct access to data can also offer useful insights for scholars interested in methods. Documentation of projects provides the way to understand how the design was arrived at, what decisions about technical methods were made, and why. 

At the beginning of a GIS project, consider these factors: 

* What is the base map and is it anachronistic in relation to the data? Does it show features of the landscape that would not have been present at the time of the events?
  
* Is the base map focused on roads, rivers, and other transportation routes? Or on geological and physical features? Does it map administrative boundaries? Or show cultural aspects of an area? Is the map suited to the project or was it merely a convenience? 

* What layers exist and how do they support the base map? Are they concise? Is the data evident? Can you toggle the layers easily? What data belongs on which layer? 

* What kinds of data are being mapped? Are they mainly coordinate points? Or do they have a spatial dimension in which the location is a dynamic aspect of the events shown? 

* Is the map still working or are there notices about errors, missing plugins, or other absent functionality? 
  
* Can you see the data and its structure? What elements were codified in the data? Was it created in a markup language, in GeoJSON, or a spread-sheet, and what custom fields were defined by the researchers? 

* Was the data quantitative or qualitative and how were these given graphical expression? 

* Does the map serve as a picture of a location or as an informative element of the research? If the map is a historical map, have its features been connected to a contemporary coordinate system? 

* How are elements of spatial experience communicated in the projectthrough narration, visualization, or primary documents? 

* If pop-up windows are used to display comments and/or documents (images, correspondence, newspapers etc.), do they block the view of the map? How effective is the connection between the depiction of space or geography and the display?

Exercise #4: gallery of projects https://anterotesis.com/wordpress/mapping-resources/dh-gis-projects/ Look through some of the projects in this list and see how they meet the criteria outlined above. Which are still working, which are not, and how effectively do they integrate research issues, data, maps, and arguments?
