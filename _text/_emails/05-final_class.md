Hi everyone --

As mentioned in yesterday’s class, please note that there will be no presentations expected tomorrow. Initially, I had thought you would present the methodological/critical steps this week, following last week’s dataset identification. However, it turns out most of you have already considered and addressed these aspects in your previous presentations. So, there’s really no need for another round of presentations tomorrow.

For those who were unable to attend class yesterday, I encourage you to review the slides (see here) from our session. I detailed an example of a speculative project connected to our postcard dataset.

Finally, if you wish to discuss your ideas for the final project, don’t hesitate to send me an email (I aim to respond within 3 days), or drop by during my extended office hours at the Tiger Tea Room:

April 25 (thurs), 1:00-2:30 PM
April 26 (fri), 3:00-4:00 PM
April 29 (mon), 1:00-3:00 PM
April 30 (tues), 1:00-2:00 PM
May 1 (wed), 3:00-4:00 PM
May 2 (thurs), 1:00-2:00 PM

For tomorrow’s class, there are no new supplementary materials to read. We will continue our discussion on the future of digital humanities and the moral, ethical, and activist principles that are so integral to the work of the DH community. The materials from the last class (i.e., the presentation on data feminism by Klein and D’Ignazio, and the DH manifesto), will still be relevant, so it’s good to have those fresh in your mind!

Looking forward to our final class --

Wouter
