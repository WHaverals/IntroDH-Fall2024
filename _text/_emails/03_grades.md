Dear [student],

As we approach week 10 (and the deadline to elect the P/D/F grading option), I wanted to provide you with an update on your performance in our course.

Based on the work submitted up until week 7, which includes your Perusall annotations, quality of posted reflections, participation in class discussions, the written Data Bio and your presentation of it, your current grade stands at [grade] (the median grade in the class is [median]). It's important to remember that this is an *interim evaluation*. The final written assignment (which will constitute 30% of the final grade)—obviously—has not yet been factored in. Therefore, this grade is purely indicative of your progress and should serve as a touchstone to inform any decisions regarding the P/D/F option.

As always, I am available to discuss your progress in the course, your grade, or any other concerns you may have. You can always swing by at the Tiger Tea Room during my office hours: Tues/Thurs 1:00-2:00PM. If these times do not work for you, please let me know, and we can find an alternative time or place to meet!

As mentioned in today's class, I want you to prepare a short, *informal pitch for our class on April 11*. This exercise is designed to kickstart your thought process for the final assignment—a digital humanities research proposal that is speculative, yet grounded in potential. During this presentation, I'd like you to outline a possible research question/something that could make for a DH project, and identify a dataset you might explore. You’ll have to make it snappy, though. You are allotted just 2 slides and 2 minutes (think of it as an elevator pitch; the slide deck for this session is available on the course website). Our aim for this session will be to crystalize your ideas, and to benefit from our class's "collective brain".

To allow you some breathing room to prepare, there will be no Perusall annotations required for the session on April 11, nor will you need to upload a reflection to Slack.

Best wishes,

Wouter
