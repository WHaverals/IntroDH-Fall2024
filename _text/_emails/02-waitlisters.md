Dear [STUDENT_NAME],
 
Thank you for your email and for expressing your interest in the Introduction to Digital Humanities course!
 
Regarding your query about an additional spot in the course: the Office of the Registrar sent out an email today so that you could be accommodated in the class. If you haven’t checked already, please look through your inbox (and possibly your spam folder) for an email from the registration system. This email contains the necessary instructions for signing up for the course.
 
If you did not receive this email, or if there are any issues with the registration process, let me know so that I can assist you further.
 
Looking forward to potentially having you in the class and exploring the exciting world of Digital Humanities together!
 
Below also goes the introductory e-mail that I sent out everyone about our first class tomorrow.
 
Best regards,
