# Welcome to "Introduction to Digital Humanities"! (HUM 346 / ENG 256 / CDH 346)

Dear students -
 
I hope the start of the semester is treating you well! I also hope you are eager for the adventures ahead of us in the course Introduction to Digital Humanities (HUM 346 / ENG 256 / CDH 346), which begins tomorrow from 11:00 AM to 12:20 PM. After some effort to secure the perfect location, I am pleased to announce that our classes will be held in the wonderful setting of Chancellor 105.
 
For our first gathering, thereâ€™s no need to prepare anything in advance. The agenda for tomorrow is simply to get to know each other and to go over the contents that make up our course. The session will be an opportunity for us to become acquainted, discussing our interests, backgrounds, and what we hope to achieve by the end of the term.
 
I have set up a Slack workspace for our seminars, which can be found here. See if you can join this already before our classes start, as we will be using Slack for sharing resources, updates, and assignment posts.
 
I am looking forward to meeting each of you! Should you have any questions or concerns before our first meeting, feel free to reach out.
 
Best wishes,
 
Wouter
