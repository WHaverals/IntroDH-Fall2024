## Data Bio (written)

- analysis of data collection limitations is thorough
- acknowledges the biases and gaps in data, good understanding of the complexities of data integrity
- good reflection on the inherent challenges of relying on DOJ information; great critical thinking
- sources properly cited
- minor typos: “Dying Inside,” (comma); illness/ natural cause (slash)
- "While there is no reason to believe that Reuters would be motivated to manipulate the data around jail deaths [...]", briefly state why Reuters is a reliable source.
- the data bio identifies "Reuters journalists" as the data collectors; Reuters is a big agency, with many journalists around the globe. An even more specific identification would be helpful to scrutinize the data collection process. How many people were involved in the porcess, where were they based.
- Was the work of the Reuters journalists peer-reviewed? Have other news agencies corroborated their findings? Were findings picked up by other news outlets?
- really liked the final sentence, strong conclusion!
- great job overall, well done!

## Emanuelle

- participation in het begin niet veel, maar over de course of time steeds meer geengageerd (dit zie ik ook in de participation van de laatste 2 weken, die ik nog niet meegenomen heb in de berekening van je graad op dit ogenblik), so but improved over time! zoals je zelf al aanhaalt, het is belangrijk om jezelf te blijven pushen om actiever deel te nemen aan de discussies, maar ik zie zeker een positieve evolutie. 
- quality of reflections is excellent, one was marked late (in week 4), but this was the only one; the reflections are thorough, well-structured, and show a deep engagement with the readings.
- Perusall annotations: in de eerste weken zijn er enkele die geen annotaties hebben (Ramsay's article, Gebru et al.'s article); in de latere weken zijn de annotaties en interactie met de readings wel goed, en dit is ook te zien in de kwaliteit van de reflections; en in de participation during class. Kortom, ook hier een positieve evolutie.
- liked the presentation, alhtough it did go significantly over time (but this was the case for most of your peers as well, so comparatively it's not a big issue)
- overall reflections are good, in the beginning more on the suface, but starting from week 4 i niticed more deeper interactions with the readings, tying the different sources together, so here too, there's a lot of improvement already made,
- data bio
  - thorough overview of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft dataset; introduction and content description is clear; outlines dataset scope and historical breadth
  - mentions the collaborative team's composition + their roles in data collection and processing
  - discusses the grant support, giving context to the dataset's creation
  - great acknowledgement of the limitations of historical data; while also pointing out the efforts made to create a comprehensive digital resource
  - "If the interface were to provide users with online access to the original documents that would be a significant step towards ensuring transparency and opening avenues for further research in this realm." This is a great point.
  - "it is difficult to completely streamline data points for comparison and analysis in this dataset"; I kinda get what you mean by this, but would you be able to elaborate a bit more on this?
  - nuanced understanding of the challenges in historical research
  - 780 words, 3 pages (1000-1500 wors was the assignment)
  - small typos: "January, 2003" (comma); "the the" (double article); "Yoeman" (Yeoman)
  - taken from the website, but what does this actually mean: "They modeled the database around a flat-field prototype []"? What is a flat-field prototype?

I hope heel erg dat je de laatste weken nog even blijft pushen om actief deel te nemen aan de discussies, want je hebt zeker interessante dingen te zeggen, en het is altijd fijn om jouw perspectief te horen.

### EMAIL FEEDBACK to EMANUELLE


## Raphi

- Participation, reflections and annotations -- improved over the course of the semester. I really enjoy your contributions to the discussions, and I think you have a lot of interesting things to say. Ik apprecieer de vragen of tussenkomsten die je maakt. Je benadert alle onderwerpen met een open mind en tijdens de hands-on gedeelten van de les merk ik dat je actief probeert om de verschillende tools en technieken te begrijpen en toe te passen (de weg is belangrijker dan het doel of het resultaat hierbij). Verder heb ik gemerkt dat je over de loop van het semester de readings steeds diepgaander bent gaan benaderen en bent gaan bevragen. Ik zie dit in je Perusall annotaties, maar bovenal in de reflecties waarin je vooral sinds week 4 veel rake observaties maakt. Je weet ook de zaken over de artikels heen met elkaar te verbinden. Kortom hier ben je heel goed bezig!

- Data Bio written (ik stuurde deze feedback eveneens aan Emanuelle, dus dit gedeeltje is identiek voor jullie):

Here are some of my notes on your written Data Bio:
 
thorough overview of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft dataset; introduction and content description is clear
mentions the collaborative team’s composition + their roles in data collection and processing, great
discusses the grant support, giving more context to the dataset’s creation
great acknowledgement of the limitations of historical data; while also pointing out the efforts made to create a comprehensive digital resource
suggestion for improving the interface by providing access to original documents is great
“It is difficult to completely streamline data points for comparison and analysis in this dataset” – can you expand on this? It’s an interesting point that would benefit from further explanation.
the length of the bio was shorter than the assignment called for (780 words vs. the 1000-1500 word target)
small typos noted: “January, 2003” (comma); “Yoeman” should be “Yeoman”
“They modeled the database around a flat-field prototype” – what does this mean, could you clarify this process?
 
Your and Emanuelle's presentation of the Data Bio was great—you’re an excellent presentation duo. The witchcraft dataset was introduced comprehensively, and you pointed out some of its limitations and biases adequately. And you only went slightly over time, which was definitely more of an issue with presentations by some of your peers.

I hope this feedback is helpful as you work on finalizing the semester’s assignments! Keep up the great effort, and I’m confident you’ll continue to improve! Don’t hesitate to swing by during office hours or reach out via email, also regarding the final assignment. I'm here to support you every step of the way.

### EMAIL RAPHI

Hi Raphi -

Whoa, so great that you’re the Archives editor of the Prince! Ever since I found out the Prince has all of its archives available online, I’ve found myself visiting the website now and then to look at what a great digitization project this is, or just browse random, old newspaper copies. It’s a really impressive time capsule of student culture! 

In that respect, you could also propose in your speculative project that you want to undertake a cross-Ivy newspaper investigation, specifically in terms of campus protests. The fact that other Ivy’s archives are not nearly as good as Princeton does not surprise me! What gaps do you identify? What would your project need in terms of material? It seems that a “digitization effort” is inevitable to make such a comparison possible; report on that, and then on some other—again—speculative steps you would need to take to carry out such a project. In other words, you don’t need to confine yourself to the data that is already out there. If it isn’t: report on how you would like to get to the ideal project outcome, even if that requires digitizing other Ivy’s archives! I hope this helps! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions!

And of course, I can also give you a bit more information on your overall performance in class. Let’s look at how you can build on what has already been very solid work in our class as we move forward. I’ll share some of my notes and feedback here:

Your Perusall annotations, reflections, and participation have shown considerable improvement over the course of the semester. I’ve really enjoyed your contributions to our discussions; you bring a lot of valuable insights and interesting perspectives to the table. I appreciate the questions and interventions you make, approaching every topic with an open mind. During the hands-on portions of our lessons, it’s clear that you actively try to understand and apply the different tools and techniques (with these tutorials, the journey is more important than the destination or result). Furthermore, I’ve noticed that as the semester has progressed, you’ve started to engage with the readings in a much deeper and more critical manner. This is evident in your Perusall annotations, but especially in the reflections posted on Slack. Particularly since week 5, you’ve made many great observations, and you are connecting themes across articles. In short, you’re doing exceptionally well in this area!

Regarding your written Data Bio, the feedback I have for you mirrors what I’ve also shared with Emanuelle:

•	thorough overview of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft dataset; introduction and content description is clear
•	mentions the collaborative team’s composition + their roles in data collection and processing, great
•	discusses the grant support, giving more context to the dataset’s creation
•	great acknowledgement of the limitations of historical data; while also pointing out the efforts made to create a comprehensive digital resource
•	suggestion for improving the interface by providing access to original documents is great
•	“It is difficult to completely streamline data points for comparison and analysis in this dataset” – can you expand on this? It’s an interesting point that would benefit from further explanation.
•	the length of the bio was shorter than the assignment called for (780 words vs. the 1000-1500 word target)
•	small typos noted: “January, 2003” (comma); “Yoeman” should be “Yeoman”

### EMAIL ANYA

Hi Anya—
 
In response to your other email: get well soon! No worries about missing class today; we went over a humanistic approach to network analysis, looked at some examples, and what can actually be gained from it. During the final 20 minutes of class, we played around with a toy network in the tool Gephi. The instructions for this tutorial are also part of the slide deck. If you go over it in your own time and see if you understand the main takeaway points, you’re fine.
 
Regarding your question about the final assignment: you can definitely go for a more sociological research question! Many of the Digital Humanities projects we visited over the course of the semester have some kind of sociological narrative to it, think of Mark Allen Rhodes’ project on Paul Robeson, or Robert Nelson’s Mining the Dispatch. A lot of mapping projects in DH, but especially network projects have a sociological angle. Is there anything in that field that you would be interested in? Is there a dataset that you’re envisaging, a research question that deserves interest, or just something that deserves to be more digitally visible?
 
Unfortunately, I can’t provide you with past examples, since there aren’t any. But you could frame the Princeton Historical Postcards as an example. 1) Making available the images, 2) Transcribing the messages on the back, 3) Georeferencing the locations mentioned on the front, 4) Building a digital map that shows the locations of the postcards, and where they were sent to. I’ll try to expand on this example of my own in next week’s class a little bit.
 
I hope this already helps! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have other/more questions! Happy to help!
 
Best—
Wouter

## Colin

- very strong reflections; you engage deeply with the readings and bring in your own perspectives and experiences; I appreciate the connections you make between the readings and your own research interests. One of the strongest reflections you've written was that on Wevers & Smits's article, reflecting on what they were actually advocating for (i.e. rather uncritcally adopting OpenAI's CLIP model). This was a great observation. Minor note: one reflection was marked late (week 4), but this was the only one and it has a very limited impact on yiur grade. 

Your and Melissa's written data bio was also marked highly (A), i'll share some of my notes here below:

- effective and very comprehensive outline of the inception, challenges, and contributions of the COVID Tracking Project;
- good understanding of the project's limitations and biases, and the challenges of data integrity;
- attention to the data collection process, including volunteer efforts, manual efforts, cross checks, etc. this part is really great, and well-described + reflection on potential human error
- impact of the project is also well-discussed, including the project's role in filling gaps in federal data collection;
- mention of the project being "owned" by The Atlantic could've been phrased differently. The Atlantic was definitely the main media partner; the data itself is available to all under the very permissive CC BY-NC-4.0 license; in terms of actual "ownership", the data is now housed at the University of California, San Francisco;
- great discussion of the volunteer data collection process, and the schedule -- this was very insightful, because it shows the human side of the project + the impact of what data collection actually looks like

A

A- for the presentation of the data bio; the presentation was well-structured and informative. Went significantly over time, but this was the case for most of your peers as well, so comparatively it's not a big issue.

### EMAIL COLIN

Hi Colin,

Thanks for reaching out--apologies for my delayed response--and of course: I’m happy to provide more details on the aspects of your performance!

Firstly, your Perusall annotations and reflections and interventions during our classes and are notably strong; you engage deeply with the readings and bring in your own perspectives, which significantly enriches also the in-class discussions. A particular highlight for me was your reflection on Wevers & Smits’s article regarding their rather uncritical adoption of OpenAI’s CLIP model. This was such a good observation, and to me this illustrates how perceptive you are to the various sensitivities in DH. There was one instance where a reflection was submitted late (week 6, also the reflection on Wever and Smits), but this was an isolated event and only had a very limited impact on your overall grade.

In terms of your written Data Bio, which you collaborated on with Melissa, you both received a high mark (A). Here are some of my shorthand notes:

- effective and very comprehensive outline of the inception, challenges, and contributions of the COVID Tracking Project
- excellent understanding of the project's limitations and biases, as well as the challenges of data integrity; detailed and insightful, I learned a lot from this section
- the discussion on the data collection process, including the volunteer efforts and manual cross-checks, is particularly strong and well-described; reflection on potential human error adds a thoughtful dimension to analysis
- the project's impact, including its role in filling gaps in federal data collection is well-discussed (so crazy that a team of journalists actually *had* to do what the federal government should have been doing);
- the mention of the project being "owned" by The Atlantic could have been phrased differently, I believe--while The Atlantic was definitely the main media partner, the data itself is available to all under the very permissive CC BY-NC-4.0 license + the actual "ownership" of the data now resides with the University of California. Honestly, it's a bit unclear to me too, as to who now owns the data (especailly after the project was shut down), could've made for a great discussion point;
- I esp. liked the discussion on the volunteer data collection process (also how they used Slack) and the schedule-this really showcased the human side of the project and various practical implications of data collection!
 
Your and Melissa’s presentation of the Data Bio was awarded an A-. The presentation was well-structured and informative--touching on all the major elements present in the written Data Bio, though it went significantly over time. This was a common issue among your peers, so comparatively, it’s not a significant concern, but definitely something to keep in mind for future presentations (especially for the presentation in the final week, this will be important!).

I hope this breakdown helps! Feel free to reach out via email, or swing by during office hours. Here to support your learning in any way I can.

Best wishes,

Wouter

## Melissa

- perusall annotations and reflections overall great: i especaiall yenjoy reading your reflections as you are not just taking it all in what the authors are saying, but you are also reflecting actively on what the implications are; i notice you like asking questions in you refelctions--this is really great, because the questions then pop up during our class discussions, and it shows you are actively engaging with the material

Hi Melissa--
Thanks for reaching out, apologies for the delay! I'd be happy to provide some insights into the various components of the course assessments.

Your Perusall annotations and reflections posted on Slack have been consistently strong throughout the semester. I particularly enjoy reading your reflections because you do more than just absorb the content; you actively engage with it tying together the materials + interrogating the readings! Your reflections contain a lot of questions-- which is really excellent; it both shows your engagement with the materials,but you are also bringing these questions to the classes and then stimulating our class discussions! In short, this is all great work.

## Talia Goldman

Data bio written (B+)

- thorough exploration of the dataset's background;
- strong context for understanding the dataset: motivation behind the data collection, and alignment with labor movements in the arts sector:
- description of the data collection via Google spreadsheets and Forms is great, also great is thedata loss provides valuable insight into the practical challenges of crowdsourced data initiatives
- good discussion of potential uses for the dataset;
- highlighting how such information can be used to address disparities within the museum and art sectors
- some things to consider: the dataset is not very well-documented, e.g. you mention "a group of museum and arts organization workers", but who is actually behind this data collection?, how many people were involved are/were part of this group, where were they based, is it a union, a non-profit, a group of journalists, etc.? Even if this information is not available, it's good to point it out as this is a major limitation of the dataset. Remember, it's always actual **people** who collect data, not just an abstract "group" or "organization"
- you mention that "some data was accidently deleted off the editable [Google] spreadsheet", but doesn't Google spreadsheets have a version history? Couldn't this data have been recovered? This is a minor point, and obviously, **you** are not responsible for the data loss, but it has me wondering: it seems the people behind it weren't quite tech-savvy, or maybe they didn't care enough about the data to keep it safe...;
- gret that you're pointing out the "the lack of standardization", which is another major issue;
- in short, this is a very messy dataset, there's a lot of things "wrong" with it, but you've done a great job in pointing out the limitations and biases in the data + pointing out the challenges of data integrity (e.g. potential data authentication issues...); this shows your understanding of the complexities involved in self-reported data!

## James Sowerby

Data Bio: 
- great contextualization of the collection within the broader narratives of American culinary history
- explanation of the digitization process and metadata cataloging is exemplary, providing a clear understanding of how the collection was transitioned to a digital format
- discussion on selection bias and the potential limitations, shows a high level of critical engagement with the material
- excellent: "They clarify that the current site is a migration of the original published project (itself archived by the Library of Congress here)." This is a great point, and it shows you've done your homework!
- somethign i found missing: what are the actual forms that users can access the data in? Images, txt, xml, html...

Your Perusall annotations and reflections posted on Slack have been consistently strong throughout the semester. I particularly enjoy reading your reflections because you do more than just absorb the content; you actively engage with it tying together the materials + you seem to enjoy interrogating the readings! You are also bringing the questions, and points of criitcism you raise in the reflections into the classroom, stimulating our discussions! In short, this is all great work.

In terms of your written Data Bio, you both received a B+. Here are some of my shorthand notes:

Written data bio:

- great that you pointed out the curiosity-drivenness of the project, and see how this is representative of DH research in general
- your pulling some direct quatations from a source... im assuming the project's website, but it's not clear where you're pulling this from; always good to provide a source for your quotes. I'm aunable to check some of the direct quotes. There's some papers, a book, a website that you're pulling this from, and it's always good to provide a source for your quotes.
- you say "comic data is subsequently organized into accessible charts", for one the data itself isnt organized into charts, but the data is visualized in charts; and secondly, what do you mean by "accessible"? secondly, what makes them accessible? easily understandable? easily navigable? easily downloadable?
- i'm curious where this project gets information on Author's Country of Residence, Author's Country of Origin, Gender of Authors from. The webiste provides graphs for these, but the actual data source is obscure. So when your sayingn: "Differences in gender are explored, geographical range, and genre studies are available in easy-to-read and accessible charts." bit more critical engagement or asking questions wouldve been great.
- There are some very confusing graphs too, like this one: https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/graphic-literature/gncorpus/charts/genderIllustrator.php 
- you mention that they did eye-tracking studies (and the data is unavailable) but you don't mention where someone is qable to find the results of this. 
- "involvement in the public sphere is clearly described." sure, but where? :) 
- you say: "all graphic novels published between the 1970s and 2010s" but earlier you mentioned a more exact date range -- make sure to stick to the accurate one!
- someting that I find odd about this dataset is the fact that they mention: only Gn's "written in English" was collected (you mention this too in your data bio), but some graphic novels are  in fact translated _into_ english. The compilers of the dataset are not very transparent about this bias. Now there are e.g. gn's in the dataset that originally appeared in Japanese and only later translated into English. In other word, it simply isnt super correct to say that the dataset contains gn's written in English -- some of them are translations! But was collecting translqtions part of the original initiative?  Very unclear. You were aaaalmost getting at this point of criticism in your data bio when pointing out the limitations and gaps in the dataset, but you could've gone a bit further here.
- great that your prointing out that the authors make available not only dataset, but also research results and other materials, e.g. slides used in conferences, classes, etc.
- i'm missing a mention of the format that the data is available in. csv files with all the numbers can be downloaded from their webiste

### EMAIL PIPPA

Hi Pippa--

Thanks for reaching out, apologies for the delay! I’d be happy to provide some insights into the various components of the course assessments.

Your engagement with the course materials, particularly through your Perusall annotations and reflections on Slack, has been consistently impressive. Your reflections go beyond just absorbing the contents of the materials; you effectively tie them together and bring in critical points of discussion + you're bringing  those questions and points of criticism with yuou to our discussions in class. In short, this is all great work!

Regarding your written Data Bio, you received a B+. Here are some of my shorthand notes:

-  highlighting the curiosity-driven nature of DH research is a great point, this project-indeed- exemplifies what can be recognized as the spirit of DH research;
- citations need clarity; ensure direct quotes are paired with a reference to the source for context and verification;
- what do you mean by "accessible charts"? i'm wondering, what makes charts "accessible" (understandability, navigation, downloadability?...);
- you mention the absence of the eye-tracking study results; indicating *where* the results of these experiments might still be found would add to your bio’s comprehensiveness;
- you mention "involvement in the public sphere is clearly described" -- 1. I'm unable to verify this claim (see point about sources above), and 2. what does this actually mean? what kind of involvement does this project have in the "public sphere"?;
- you write: "all graphic novels published between the 1970s and 2010s", but earlier in the bio you mention a more exact date range -- make sure to stick to the specific one throughout the paper;
- the dataset's claim of containing works 'written in English' is a bit misleading, as it also includes translated graphic novels. This bias is not transparently addressed by the dataset creators. You were almost getting at this point of criticism in your data bio when pointing out the limitations and gaps in the dataset, but you could've gone a bit further here;

Your presentation of the Data Bio was awarded an A-. The presentation was well-structured and informative--touching on all the major elements present in the written Data Bio.
