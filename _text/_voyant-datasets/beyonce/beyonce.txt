If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me
Thank you so much. Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible

A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh

Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again

Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh

They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya

Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again

Ven y quédate conmigo
Dame el corazón vida mía estoy muriendo lento en mi prisión
Anda dime lo que sientes quitate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
Y después te llevare hasta donde quieras sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya se a donde voy
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Yo nací para tus ojos, para nadie más
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, corazón de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
Y después te llevare hasta donde quiera
Sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga porque ya se a donde voy
Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado
Nuestro amor
If this what you truly want
Her hair over mine
Her hands as gloves
Her teeth as confetti
So what are you gonna say at my funeral, now that you've killed me? Here lies the body of the love of my life, whose heart I broke without a gun to my head. Here lies the mother of my children, both living and dead. Rest in peace, my true love, who I took for granted. Most bomb p*ssy who, because of me, sleep evaded. Her shroud is loneliness. Her god was listening. Her heaven will be a love without betrayal. Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.
TO MY DEAREST FANS in ANTWERP
I’ve never postponed a show in my life
It was very hard for me
I promise I will make it up very soon
I’m sorry if I disappointed you
Thank you for your concern
I'm feeling much better now
And I'm ready to give you a great show
See you tonight
All my love
Beyonce
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah, when you smile
You smile, Ooh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine
At last
Oh!
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I
I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria
Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria
Do you think
You could fall for a woman like me
'Cause I find it hard to trust
I need too much
And I really don't believe in love, no no
Do you think
That I could be the girl of your dreams
Sometimes I don't let things go
Get emotional
And sometimes I'm just out of control
You need to stop for a minute
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Too deep)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Do you think
That I could be the one that you seek
'Cause baby I'm one step ahead
You're two steps behind
But baby I don't mind
Do you think
That I can make you real happy baby
Just don't get me wrong
My loving is so strong
But I ain't tryna lead you on
You need to stop for a minute
(No no)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(No no)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
(Seems)
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
(Woman like me)
You need to think about it
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(Without it)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Woman like me
Oh
You need to stop for a minute
(Stop for a minute)
Before you get too, deep up in it
(Before you get too deep up in it)
'Cause everything ain't what it seems
It's hard loving a woman
A woman like me
You need to think about it
(Think about it, baby)
Before you get hooked on the venom
And can't live without it
(No, no)
Can't believe everything you see
It's hard loving a woman
{Outro: Beyoncé}

Kept my dick wet with that same old bet
Oh and you
You, and your head high
And your tears dry
Get on without your guy
And I, I, I went back to what I knew
So far removed from all we been through
Oh-oh, and you, and you, and you, you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked
You'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her and you go back too
You go back too
I, I loved you much
It's not enough
I love blowing you a love puff
And life, is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her and I go back too
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back too
I go back to black
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
Everybody know that face
Even with her head low, they still know that shape
When she come through the club, people take they place
Chicks throwin' handcuffs 'cause they knowin' that they man ain't safe
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
Everybody can't do this
Some ain't gotta clue till they hear me spit
Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick
Is it the change or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick
'Cause she the one switchin' up flows
If it's four door, two gotta go
Chicks like, what kinda jeans is those?
And fellas watchin' like, please, get low
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
When you see that girl comin', back up

This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
She ain't the average chick, she the baddest chick
For this type of girl it's not that hard
You see her 'cause she too far gone
Though they pray and pray for her downfall
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin' what it do fit to be a plus
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Back up, back up
When you see that girl comin', back up
She ain't yo' average chick--back up
This is for the, the, the club
And this is for the people on the, the, the block

There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

The way you touch me lets me know you're mine
I'd rather be with you
'Cause I love the way you scream my name
And there's no other man that gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because you hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy, I'd rather be with you (Boy, I'd rather be with you)

Stare into my eyes

Boy, don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you, whoa
There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you

It's like a high I can't come down from you

WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE KILLINGS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE A STAND AND DEMAND THAT THEY “STOP KILLING US.”
WE DON'T NEED SYMPATHY. WE NEED EVERYONE TO RESPECT OUR LIVES.
WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AS A COMMUNITY AND FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT MURDER OR ANY VIOLENT ACTION BY THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO PROTECT US SHOULD CONSISTENTLY GO UNPUNISHED.
THESE ROBBERIES OF LIVES MAKE US FEEL HELPLESS AND HOPELESS BUT WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE NEXT GENERATION, FOR THE NEXT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE IN GOOD.
THIS IS A HUMAN FIGHT. NO MATTER YOUR RACE, GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR ANYONE WHO FEELS MARGINALIZED, WHO IS STRUGGLING FOR FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
THIS IS NOT A PLEA TO ALL POLICE OFFICERS BUT TOWARD ANY HUMAN BEING WHO FAILS TO VALUE LIFE. THE WAR ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALL MINORITIES NEEDS TO BE OVER.
FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE. HATE WILL NOT WIN.
WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANNEL OUR ANGER AND FRUSTRATION INTO ACTION. WE MUST USE OUR VOICES TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN OUR DISTRICTS AND DEMAND SOCIAL AND JUDICIAL CHANGES.
WHILE WE PRAY FOR THE FAMILIES OF ALTON STERLING AND PHILANDO CASTILE, WE WILL ALSO PRAY FOR AN END TO THIS PLAGUE OF INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
CLICK IN TO CONTACT THE POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS IN YOUR AREA. YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD.

We're taking this a little too far

On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you

Doing what we like to do, our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel
It's true to the heart, she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keeping me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
Now they 'bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It won't be that, oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walking this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working at Kermain, Birkin Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody takes my place
Yeah-hee
(Break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could’ve been
But still ,you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you’re the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don’t wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don’t want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I’m no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I want to put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you’re in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath with out you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath with out my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
I'm Bug a Boo Daddy
AKA me, myself
Yo, let's take a group pic, bro, come on, come on, come on
And I
I'm Bug a Boo Up-Grade-You (Cha ching)
Also known as shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (Shinin', yeah)
I'm Bug a... I'm Bug a Boo Sweet Dreams
Also known as Blow
I'm Bug a Boo Disappear
Also known as Ave Marie
I'm Bug a Boo Rocket
Also known as "If I Were a Boy"
I'm Bug a Boo We Gotta Work It Out, hey
Also known as we like to party
Hey, hey, hey, let's go, huh
Bug a Boo, huh
All together now
Carmen why you bugin', this ain't time for lovin'
Blaze got the doe we should stick it in the oven
Big boy clubbing, no more this kid scrubbing, up in Roscoes grubbing
Keep the busiest commin'
You know he do cats and keep running staying on sunset
Air force oneing, You know me and Nicki got the duce on the sicky
Tripping cause the ready came at hit you with a hickey
You got the dreams, all we need is the beams
Nineteen, Nineteen
Ice cream, Vanilla bean
It might seem, but everything that glitters don't bling
I ain't ever net these brothers hows that the right thing
...
The cards never lie, my last breath a sigh
And now I think about if it's my time to die
I don't know what I was thinking, steady wasting time with Hill
And I need to live my life because my time is unforgiven
I can't understand how my life changed around
Manifest my destiny, is it the brown underground?
Blue skies are turning gray it's the point of indecision
Believing in the cards you must respect its every vision
Girlfriend, get your mind on line
Don't spend your time cause you can't waste your time
Everyday like it's your last, but you must feel divine
Intervention comes and snatch up all your dreams from behind
Love!
You feel it and you got to let them know it
Love!
Your heart and that's the feeling that you go with
If you have a dream you need to go and let them know it
Cause you could wake up in the morning and it could be over
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dream, let me see another dawn
Carmen, don't listen cause the cards have deceit
Just slide him the money, we don't need a receipt
Truth only exists within the eyes of the beholder
Plus he's kind of young for fortune telling
He probably should be older
But the cards never lie, I thought I told you
Now it's her turn to try, to reach her goals before she reaches the sky
This is love
It's like I'm trying to throw my life away
Sometimes love is all you got and other times it makes you pay
Well when you finally rise
Then you'll realize
The windows to the soul are not the hips but the eyes
Oh You could wish on the stars but they're dead, just a lie
But they shine just as bright as they did their entire life
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn
No, No, No, No
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go
Just, Just, Just let me stay home
Just let me live my dreams, let me see another dawn

You have to come home
We've really needed you
You're the king
I gotta give up to quiet
The storm that rages inside
The way that I hid my damage pride
You gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strength to follow it through
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control
I'm opening up
Show me a sign I can't believe
These crazy emotions flow through me
I'm gonna explode, oh
You take me away
And what is my ordinary life
I won't be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We'll only find ourselves by losing all, no
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
New horizon ready to paint
With every breath, you take me away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, we're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our soul
So let it show, so let it show
We can't pretend, we can't pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control, control, control, control
Control, control, control, control

I remember when you use to take me on a bike ride everyday on the bayou
(You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)
Because you loved me, I overcome, yeah
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why…
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Daddy, daddy, daddy...
I still remember the expression on your face
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should've seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)
Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I know you're there for me
You cure my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why…
I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me
Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in, I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
For men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Lord, why did you pick me?
Can't stop my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy
(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you daddy.)
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy...

Watch out for your sister"
That's when Daddy looked at me

'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe

Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe

Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me

Show you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I’m dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin’ good
Wanna show you how much, how much you’re understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you’re patient with me bay
Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo heart

Show ya, show ya, show ya til you’re through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That’s why I’m backin’ this thing back
Pop poppin’ this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won’t never ever eh-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don’t thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it’s the pre game show
Daddy you know what’s up
Hey Shawty show me that you love the way, that I do
Whatever, to show the world I’m crazy bout you
I tell them everything amazing bout you
The reason behind me saying I do
It’s hidden in the way you toot it in the air and drop it down
And give it to me dirty when nobody ain’t around
Your legs in the air and your clothes on the ground
And your head in the pillow, trying to hold in the sound
Now come here Shawty, let me grab and hold that
Remote control that, I love to rock when you you there for me
I want you to know that, when you undressing
It’s like I’m living out a fantasy
Cause you so soft, and I’m not that
You want this, well you got that
Magnum lifestyle, know I’m bout that
That Bentley, lay you on top that
Knock that ass from here to tomorrow
On the balcony, out in Cabo
Know a shopping spree will follow
I’m in love, watching you model
Couple candle lights, create the ambiance
And yo lingerie and yo Louis Vuitton
Pussy sick and slow music on
And I’m watching you like it’s a movie yo
I love you
I love you
I love you
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you

The way I love you, loving me
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before, I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me

Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you

My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world
I am in love with you
You set me free

Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes

Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you

Dangerously in love

He loves me especially different
Everytime you keep me on my feet happily
Excited by your cologne, and your hands
Your smile, your intelligence
You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me
You school me, give me things to think about
Ignite me, you excite me
You love me and you like me
Incite me, Incite me to chorus
Larararilarara...
La la la la
Uh uh uh uh uh..
Dangerously In Love
I met this girl, named Nicki
I guess you could say, she was the rap queen
I met her in the studio lobby
But her booty look bigger in the magazines
She said, "Bey, would you jump in this song of mine?"
How could I resist?
When I heard little Nicki rhyme
Bass (Uh)
Hi-hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay (UH-huh, ready, uh-Huh)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my- (OH!)
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control

I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?
You be sayin'
No no no no no
When it's really
Yes yes yes yes yes
(x 4)
Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Why don't you say what's on your mind
'Cause each and everytime
You're near me
You give me signs
But when I ask you "What's the deal?"
You're holdin' it all inside
If you wanna' be with me
You gotta' keep it real
Tell me what's goin' on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come get my love
All here for you
Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care
Bug a boo(talk)
You buggin' what?
You buggin' Who?
You buggin' me
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug-a boo, a bug-a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my e-mail stop
Can you pay my bills
Can you pay my telephone bills
Can you pay my automo-bills
If you did then maybe we could chill
I don't think you do
So, you and me are through
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!
Any other day I would call
You would say, baby how's your day?
But today it ain't the same
Every other word is
Uh huh, yeah okay
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there first of all
Let me say, I am not the one
To sit around and be played
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your'one game
When you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be a reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name!

Ladies leave yo man at home(3x)
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce
Twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake
Work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist
You better dip that thing

Question: Tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell-y when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question: Tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me boy you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships
The shoes on my feet
I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing
I bought it
The rock I'm rockin'
I bought it
'Cause I depend on me
If I want it
The watch I'm wearin'
I bought it
The house I live in
I bought it
The car I'm driving
I bought it
Cause I depend on me
(I depend on me)
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Kelly, can you handle this?
Michelle, can you handle this?
Beyoncé, can you handle this?
I don't think they can handle this! (WHOO!)

I don't think you ready for this
Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
Baby, can you handle this?
I don't think you can handle this!
Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you

I'm a survivor!!
Square-cut or pear shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds, diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
I don't have a reason to cry
And I have every reason to smile
I don't have a reason to lie
When you’re already reading my mind
And I don’t have a reason to be, if I can’t be with you
And I don't need air in my lungs, if I can’t sing your song
No, I don’t need hands if I don’t get to keep you warm
And I don’t really need myself, if I don't need you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
And I don’t really need these fingers, if I don’t get to touch your spine
Well, I don’t need these legs, if I ain’t walking by your side
And I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
'Cause darling I wake up just to sleep with you
I open my eyes so I can see with you
And I live so I can die with you
I live so I can die with you
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)
I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now… Hold up!
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off

But you ain't gonna need any hands at all
Now don't take this as misogyny when I say take this mahogany
And let me put it all in until it's hard to see
Beat it up and reverse till it's hard to breathe
Ok, you're not dealing with inexperience, promise I'm giving you pipe

Shots will be in the air all night

I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl
She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest
I emit the propane
I just spit, probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg?
Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers, kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
It's on baby, let's get lost

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...
Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, now promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

In your own little universe, make me your girl
Come take my hand, I won't let you go

Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go

When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie "Baby you're my flame"
He givest fever

Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah I burn forsooth

When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy won't you treat him right
Now you've listened to my story

Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade
They give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever until you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Alright ladies and gentlemen, i want y'all to scream loud and proud for Ed Ed Sheeran
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on
Bet you nobody ever told you that you

We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

And you can say what you want, I'm the shit

I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit
I want everyone to feel like this tonight
God damn, God damn, God damn!

I'm a trainwreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean
I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all

And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you, you, you...
I'm a train wreck in the morning

Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us

Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me

Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself

Hear me out

When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." We refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. So we have come to cash this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice

Fellow great Americans, hello
This is heritage for my medicine
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights aimin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire marshalls and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Obviously guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh father can you hear me?
Hear me out
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
Cause I need freedom too!
Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new
Ooh, I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away", oh
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose, yeah
Freedom, freedom, where are you?
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'ma keep on running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves, oh

We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn’t a reality yet. Today, women make up half of the U.S. workforce, but the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes. But unless women and men both say this is unacceptable, things will not change. Men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters earn more— commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect.
Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal? These old attitudes are drilled into us from the very beginning. We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life. And we have to teach our girls that they can reach as high as humanly possible
We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities

Hey
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
A gift from virgo
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye
One day we'll make love
Finally I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
When you were born, the angels sighed in delight
They never thought they'd see such a beautiful sight
You took the breath and the world was right again
Tears were shed, how we had been blessed
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful
Well look at me, you were brought into my life
I kiss those little feet and watch for your perfect smile
And when it comes, the world stops in your eyes
I found love, I found peace of the purest kind
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You make everything right, oh
And your love, it shines so bright
You bring me back to life, back to life
You got a light inside, light inside
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful
Thank God, I get on my knees and pray
Thank God for giving me a life
You're beautiful, you're beautiful, too beautiful
God made you beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
God made you beautiful, beautiful, you're beautiful

Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart, homeboy would already know
Put a queen of your team, the hoes got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
He've been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain't nothin' like thug love, and thats real

I remember being young, tough, brave
I knew what I needed
I was spending all my nights and days laid back day dreaming
Look at me I’m a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this
Cause I put it down like that, d-down like that
And I’m making all these racks, a-all these racks
And I’m moving round like that, r-round like that
When I do it I don’t look back, d-don’t look back
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
They love the way I walk
‘Cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk ’cause I ain’t pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I’m goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, It's 'bout time I show it
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I can be bad if I want
I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want
I can go slow all night long
I’m a grown woman
I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman, and I know that I got it
I'm a grown woman, ain't got no room in my pockets
I'm a grown woman, look down, got you so excited
I really want to know if you got it like that
Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat
Go girl, she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl, can get whatever she wants
That girl, she got that tight, that tight
Them boys, will do whatever what she likes

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
(Halo, halo, I can see your halo)
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo

Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened

The risk that I'm takin'

Everywhere I'm lookin' now

Oohhhh...
Θυμησου αυτούς τους τοίχους που εγω έχτισα
Remember those walls I built
Λοιπόν, μωρό μου, αυτοι γκρεμιστηκαν
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
Και δεν μπηκαν καν στην μαχη
And they didn't even put up a fight
Και Δεν έκαναν  κανενα θορυβο
They didn't even make a sound
Βρήκα τον τρόπο για να σε αφήσω να κερδίσεις
I found a way to let you win
Αλλά πραγματικα δεν αμφεβαλα
But I never really had a doubt
Εγω στεκομαι στο φως το δικο σου halo
Standing in the light of your halo
Εγω εχω τον άγγελο μου τώρα
I got my angel now
Νιωθω σαν να εχω ξυπνήσει
It's like I've been awakened
Κάθε εμποδιο που ειχα για σενα εχει διαλυθει
Every rule I had you break it
Είναι  ρισκο αυτο που εγω παιρνω
It's the risk that I'm taking
Ποτέ δεν θα σε βγαλω εξω απο την ζωη μου
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Οπουδηποτε και αν κοιταξω τωρα
Everywhere I'm looking now
Είμαι αναμεσα στην αγκαλιά σου
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Μωρό, μπορώ να σε δω
Baby, I can see your halo
Εσυ Ξέρεις ότι εσυ μου εσωσες την ψυχη μου
You know you're my saving grace
Είσαι τα πάντα που χρειάζομαι και παραπάνω
You're everything I need and more
Είναι γραμμένα ολα  στο πρόσωπό σου
It's written all over your face
Μωρό μου, μπορω να σε αισθανθω
Baby, I can feel your halo
Προσευχήσου οτι αυτο δεν θα εξαφανισθει
Pray it won't fade away
Μπορώ να σε αισθανθώ

Μπορώ να σε δω
I can see your halo (halo) halo
Μπορώ να σε αισθανθώ
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
Μπορώ να σε δω

Με αγγιζεις σαν μια ακτίνα του ήλιου
Hit me like a ray of sun
Που ζεσταινει τη σκοτεινότερη νύχτα μου
Burning through my darkest night
Είσαι ο μοναδικος που εγω θέλω
You're the only one that I want
Σκεψου ότι είμαι εθισμένη στο φως το δικο σου
Think I'm addicted to your light
Ορκίστηκα ότι ποτέ δεν θα ξαναπεσω ψυχολογικα
I swore I'd never fall again
Αλλά αυτό δεν συνεβει ακομη αισθανομαι οτι πέφτω
But this don't even feel like falling
Την βαρυτητα δεν μπορεις να την ξεχασεις
Gravity can't forget
Με ριχνει ξανά στο έδαφος
To pull me back to the ground again
Αισθάνομαι σαν να εχω ξυπνήσει τωρα
Feels like I've been awakened
Κάθε εμποδιο που ειχα για σενα εχει διαλυθει
Every rule I had you break it
Το ρισκο που παίρνω ειναι αυτο
The risk that I'm taking
Ποτέ δεν θα σε βγαλω εξω απο την ζωη μου
I'm never gonna shut you out
Οπουδηποτε κι αν κοιταξω τώρα
Everywhere I'm looking now
Είμαι αναμεσα στην αγκαλιά σου

Deena (The Dreams)
We didn't make forever
We've each got to go our seperate way
And now we're standing here, helpless
Looking for something to say
We've been together a long time
We never thought it would end
We were always so close to each other;
You were always my friend
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love
Hard to see you cry, my love
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
We didn't want this to happen
But we shouldn't feel sad
We had a good life together
Just remember, remember, all the times we had
You know I'll always love you
You know I'll always care
And no matter I'll far I may go
In my heart you'll always be there
And it's hard to say good-bye, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to see you cry, my love (It's so hard)
Hard to open up that door
When you're not sure what you're going for
But we've got to grow
We've got to try
Though it's hard so hard
We've got to say goodbye
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(We didn't make forever, but I'll always love you)
But I'll always love you
(It's so hard, baby it's so hard)
Hard...
Part 1: Ghost
(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm
Part 2: Haunted
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
You must be on to me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
Me, me, me, me
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay
I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
I guess love just wasn't enough for us to survive
I swear, I swear, I swear I tried
You took the life right out of me
I'm so unlucky I can't breathe
You took the life right out of me, me, me, me
I'm longing for your heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat
I fought for you
The hardest, it made me the strongest
So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home
So go on go home
Padre Nuestro
Que estas en el cielo
Santificado sea tu Nombre
Venga tu reino
Hagase tu voluntad
En la tierra como en el cielo
Amen

Took me a while, but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about out my friends mouth
I've been beat down
Til he turned my life around
(turn my life around)
Seems like I always fall short, of being worthy
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar, the spotlight ain't shinin on me
(no no no no no)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
Loves me
I used to wake up somedays, and wish I'd stayed asleep
Cuz I went to bed on top of the world
Today the worlds on top of me
Everybody's got opinions (they share)
They ain't been in my position (they don't care)
That it breaks my heart when I hear what they
Have to say about me yeah (what they say)
Seems like I always fall short (fallin short)
Of bein worthy (Lord I ain't worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough (no no)
But he still loves me (still loves me)
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me (but I want to be for you)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I'm not perfect (I'm not perfect)
Yes I do wrong (yes I do wrong)
I'm trying my best (trying my best but)
But it ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
Shunned by the world (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed, cuz I ain't good
But he still loves me (I just ain't good enough)
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed
To be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cuz through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without out blame
Feels like we always fall short, of bein worthy (we are not worthy)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
I ain't no superstar (I ain't no superstar but I wanna be for you Lord)
The spotlight ain't shinin on me
Cuz I ain't good enough, but you still love me
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but (tryin my best)
It ain't good enough (I'm not good enough)
Shunned be the word (shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed (I don't succeed-ceed-ceed)
Cuz I ain't good enough, but he still loves me
(child sing with me)
I'm not perfect, yes I do wrong
I'm tryin my best but it ain't good enough
(But the Lord's been so good to me)
Shunned be the word (Shunned by the world)
If I don't succeed
Cuz I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (The Lord still loves me)
No I ain't good enough, but He still loves me
(Raise your hands if ya understand)
No I ain't good enough (How he blessed you cuz he blessed you too)
But He still loves me (even though I ain't worthy)
No I ain't good enough (you ain't worthy, He's there for you)
But He still loves me (no matter what I do)
No I ain't good enough (I ain't good enough)
But he still loves me (but the Lord still loves me)

Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-cut-something
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets
It's the player from the point
And your girl from the D
Are you infatuated with me?
I could end your curiosity
If you don't think I'm too rude
Here's your chance to make your move
I sit and wait for nobody
People say that my, my style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star
Do I blow you away?
Do I stimulate your mind?
Would you taste my love if I give you time?
I have none to waste with you
I guess you can say
My style is so crazy
I think you like it, baby
Do you want to get nasty?
I dare you to undress me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star
Undress me undress me
You can come
Come baby, undress me
Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin' down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root
Knocking boots in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell
You never can tell these days
Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!
The way I feel
Oh girl I know its bout to be
Me all over you
And damn girl you all over me
Baby, let me know if you wanna roll
With a hip hop star
Bamboos on, pants down low
I'm a rock star
Baby, let me know if you wanna ride with a
Hip hop star
I'm a rock star
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know
When I'm deep Inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
’Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?
Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that’s what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights

The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I’m ’bout that life
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off?

Yeah, H-Town all stars in the building, that's right

Seven-thirteen homey, I been on
Yeah we been here and y'all sho been gone
Screwed up captain, still repping the south
And can't none of y'all cut me off, I'm alive
Make 'em southside, cause that's Texas pride
Pimp C got me swangin' it wide, so be quiet
Bey still repping it right for H-Town
Don Keke's draped up, chopped and screwed down
I've been on, I've been on
Since back when I had braids on my dome
Underground king, sitting on my throne
Me and Bey done did number one songs
Riding candy and chrome, this Texas
Could buy a Bentley cash with this necklace
This H-Town, we drive reckless
We make 'em bow down, they gon' respect us
I been on, I been on, I been on

Cup with R, candy cars
Geto Boys, Willie D
You're plexing with Bey, you're plexing with me
These dudes in the streets, be acting mob
But go to the pen, and be playing with them boys
They are not me, they're carbon copies
If God got me, who gon' stop me
I been on, now who you goons gon' get to knock me off?
I've been boss, been on slabs, been on paint
Been on fours homey, I've been on drank, I've been had bank
Twenty-five years and ain't fell off yet, cause my flow that wet
You don't want no plex, they talk that sh-
The Queen Bey said you better bow down, bow down

Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
On, I could never be off
Hit the boulevard so hard, it'd never be soft
Elbows so long, looking like they reach out
Set of diamonds and gold in damn near each mouth
They call it Styrofoam City; Houston, Texas to be exact
Swangas on anything, it ain't gotta be a Lac
If I say I got sixteen, it ain't gotta be a rap
All them d-boys in them traps, they gotta feel that
We the big ballers and big bodies in fresh foreigners
Fresh up off the road from hustling and rap touring
While you sleeping and snoring, we creeping and pouring
BaddieBey and the Bun, baby, you can't ignore 'em
Represent for Port Arthur, get it right off the water
How you want it hard or soft, put in your order
Never the hesitators, shaking off all the haters
Ridin' for Pimp, Screw and all the Lone Star Staters, hol' up
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

Hold up, Texas trill
H-Town going down, man
It's really been weighing on me
Tell me what did I do?
To have ya'll hatin on me
When I don't have nothin' to prove
Sometimes I shake my head
When I'm layin' down in my bed
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said
When you really don't know me yet
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh
It's really been weighing on me
I'm not myself lately
I feel a little incomplete
But i'm not gonna lose no sleep
I keep it all in my mind
Cause it gotta get better in time
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine
Gotta clear up some things
There have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya
Give it a rest
You must admire me
Spend so much time with me consuming your head
(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out

La-la-la, la-la-la
Feel like I'm loosing my mind
Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe you belong to me
Oh oh
I'm going through difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this
This is my final wish
Hook:
The next time your truck rolls by

Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then

It's good to know what's goin on

You've got me chasing after you like an
Ice cream truck
I try my luck and catch up but
It's always out of luck
(And my heart just melts)
Something told me it was over (Yeah)
When I saw you and her talking deep
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me child naw naw whoo ooh
So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free now whoo ooh, Woo oh
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking of your kiss
And your warm embrace yeah
When a reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me
He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman?)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...
If, if...
If I were a
If, if...

If I were a boy
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand

I'd listen to her

Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you’re just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you

Sweetness flowing like a faucet, body bangin' no corset
Brother's wanna toss it but they lost cause my game made em forfeit
Slicker than a porpoise and thicker than a horse's
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I stick to my thesis, eyes stick to my features
Brother's try to hold but they game never reaches
And most of these cats are like the middle of peaches
I see you lookin' at but what you lookin' at
We in a bar , wanna twist me like a bottle cap
I'm tryin' to holler miss to see if you gon' holler back
Your game is whack, and no, you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
Skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunking that
But this is Milla, Lieutenant if you're wonderin'
And I'm Natheniel, (Mos Def) Mel Gibson (Sam) Danny Gloverin'
But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumb-l-in
See, I have dreams  and with a man, what will become of them?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should postpone my goals, cause he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down
I got a warrant for ya heart, in the bed, hold the trial
Get a pardon if ya come with the sargeant now
Give  the chair cause I don't care I ain't feelin' your style
Yo, I'm tryin' to get with you shorty
(But I'm not feelin' you)
But I'm an officer shorty
(My looks are killin' you)
Murder one will get you under the covers
(Game talker or manslaughter I ain't feelin' you brothers)
Eyes like the ocean
Ma I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise em' high and daddy long stroke em'
Hair like forever
I swear I could do it better
Take the gun out my holster, I still pack a baretta
You brothers sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing
But that kid
Don't waste ya time he ain't worth doin'
He just a sargeant, passin' out tickets for parking
Chickenheads cluckin'
Pitiful bulls barkin'
See this is Carmen, voice sweet as Marvin
I turn out lights with the switch when I'm walkin'
Girls steady jealous cause they man always hawkin'
Even got Lou lookin' at me like he stalkin'
And I got a mind too, I wouldn't bless you
If your first name was Ha-Chu, on Sunday singin' gospel
You ain't a dime just a nickel actin' hostile
Headed for the big top and bouncin' off this side show

It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up
But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine
You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I
I gotta move on
When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I'm somebody, somebody
And nobody's gonna hold me down
No, no nobody nobody nobody's
Gonna hold me down
I'm somebody
Somebody

Somebody
Please move move
Move right out of my life
Move it, move it
Love, love me baby

Hello

By the shining light in up the place
And when you talk everybody stop
Because they know you know just what you're sayin'
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you roll you take everyone you love along
I love that shit
Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key

And if I need ya, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…
Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum…
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby…)
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor…
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor…
Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco
Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz
Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate…
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor…)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces…)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó…)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó…)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum…
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby…)
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor…

And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out

Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days

You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book,s wilding, and you trashed the place

Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta, gotta be where you are
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Yeah, yeah, baby now
I wanna be, I wanna be, I

Na, na, yeah, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
Na, na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I wanna say I lived each day, until I die
And know that I meant something in, somebody's life
The hearts I have touched, will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I’ve done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know

I was here
I lived (I lived)

I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

Oh, I'm jealous
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"
Queen B I'm tripping 'cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off
'Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning
Know I do the same shit but girl, it's different
And if I can't, you can't fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras, you just love making me jealous
Hanging out with your girls all night and staying out 'til tomorrow
Girl, you got me all kinda crazy, sipping all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas, girl, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Oh woah)
Oh, I'm jealous (Jealous)
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine (Mine)
Oh, I'm jealous
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes (Yeah)

So I take one look in the mirror (Mirror) and I say to myself ('Self)
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this," no, no, no
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing (Oh)

But now you're too clingy for me

Michelle,
Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.
She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!
No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.
She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways
Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.
Love
Beyoncé

Let our rejoicing rise
(High as the listening)
High as the listening skies
(Let us march on)
Let us march on
('Til victory)
'Til victory is won
Yay! Beautiful job, Baba
You sound so pretty
I wanna do that again
Oh, you wanna do it again? You're like mommy, huh?
I wanna do that again
Oh, okay
'Cause it feels good
It feels good? Hahahahaha
Okay, you wanna do-
Go, lift every voice and sing
I feel we made something that made my daughter proud
Made my mother proud, my father proud, and all of the people
That are my brothers and sisters around the world
And that's why I live
I'm so lucky and grateful that I'm able to
Take all these crazy ideas and actually make it into somethin' that
Heals people and that may spark vision in people
That shows them to dream big
And shows them that they are limitless
It's possible
If my country ass can do it, they can do it
Lift every voice and sing
'Til earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies
Let us march on 'til victory is won
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I found the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen
Listen. I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It’s only beginning to find release
Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I’m not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind

But now I've gotta find my own, my own
OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind
I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya

That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind
You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying
Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind
I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying
Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)

(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?

Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
Pt. 1 Love Drought
Do you remember being born?
Are you thankful for the hips that cracked, the deep velvet of your mother
And her mother and her mother?
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
You desperately want to look like her.
How to wear your mother's lipstick
You must wear it like she wears disappointment on her face.
Your mother is a woman,
And women like her can not be contained.
I think of lovers as trees
Growing to and from one another,
Searching for the same light.
Why are you afraid of love?
I think it's not possible for someone like you.
But you are the love of my life (the love of my life)
Ten times out of nine, I know you‘re lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now (make it rain now)
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Pt. 2 Sandcastles
If we're gonna heal
We gonna start again,
You are the magician pulling me back together again,
The way you cut me in half.
Make the woman in doubt disappear.
Her heaven would be a love without betrayal.
You look nothing like your mother,
You look everything like your mother.
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no no no no no
Every promise don't work out that way
There is a curse,
That will be broken.
One thousand girls raise their arms.
Now that reconciliation is possible,
If we gonna heal,
Let it be glorious.

Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
Bring the beat in
Ooh
You put my love on top
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
But I know
Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Ooh, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top

I wanna sing this last song to all of my incredible, beautiful fans
Loyal fans, ride-or-dies
It's dedicate to my incredible Beyhive
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
And I can feel the stars whenever you're near, you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away
Everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh-woah
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
But finally you put me first
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, it's your turn, sing it, louder
You're the-
C-c-come on baby, it's-
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can-
When I need you, making everything-
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
C-c-come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Coachella, thank you so much, I love you
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us Bey
I told you that
Out on the road with my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothing going that shouldn't be goin' on
You gotta trust me, Ma
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
So controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
(Got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
Yeah, -eah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe

Foolish of me to compete

So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With your three kids in my home
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Hey!
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way

Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, myself, and I
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(So I have vowed to make it through)
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again

Oh!
I know that I will never disappoint myself

If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah! You hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
(So I have vowed to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I
Ahh, ahh, ahh all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it now
(Uh-huh... Toney Starks..
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?)
I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got
Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend
So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got..
I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself)
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way)
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again)
See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now..
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry..
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot..
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset
Changes... we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die
Beyonce.. beautiful girl
(Turn up, Beyoncé)
(Turn up, Beyoncé)
Are y'all ready, Coachella?

Put your hand up

Sing it now, hey, hey, hey
Jump, jump, yeah

I'm 'bout to flood on 'em, flood on a sinner
The rain and thunder gon' pour
Go Mutumbo, no, no sinner
You can't dim my light
'Cause when we walk up in the club
I need them sirens goin' off
Then we can look up in the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
It give me goosebumps every time
I threw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
Don't make me have to remind you
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
I promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever
Forever and ever
You heard that?
Forever and ever
That's the sound of the price goin' up
Forever, and ever-ever, and ever-ever (Yeah, yeah)
At the Saxon Madiba suite (Yeah, yeah) like Mandela
Bumpin' Fela on the Puma jet, like we from Lagos (My daughter)
Mansa Musa reincarnated, we on our levels (He 'bout business)
That's a billi', a thousand milli' (Ugh)
First one to see a B out these housing buildings

The marathon will be televised for N.I.P. (Aww yeah)​
'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba
Oshun, Queen Sheba, I am the mother
Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood
When we walk up in the club
I need the sirens goin' off
And when you look up to the sky
The tears we cry let us know that we alive, yeah, yeah
I give 'em goosebumps every time
I throw up my diamond
Together, we big timin'
The children are our reminder
I got my cup up to the heavens

Treasures dancin' on the bezel
This kinda feelin' unforgettable
Promise this my mood forever

Ever, forever

Time to break it down now
All praise due
My enemies still pressed
Cannot lose
'Cause I bet on myself
I'm dancin'
Ancestors in my step
Now, I move better, ooh
Energy pourin' out
I feel a change comin' now
Royalty in my blood from the kingdom
The more money, more problems season
But don't you let that get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh
I got my cup up to the heavens
Another night I won't remember
Promise this my mood forever
Promise this my mood forever and ever
Treasures dancin' on the bezel

All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready
Baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time
Arm in arm eye to eye
As the music plays emotions rise
I think I'm ready
In your eyes I see three words
Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready
(It's my first time
Remember your first time
It's my first time)
It felt like
You say that hes wrong you say that he's no good
Leave him alone cuz he's gona hurt you
But what they don't know is how he makes me feel
You say that he creeps always runnin the streets
He's playin the game and he'll never love me
You say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
He's the guy oh he's my man
You say you dont trust him b/c he been locked up
You say that he's trouble cuz he out in the strip club
But you were young once so you should understand
You say that you know, so you been a witness
You say its for sure so he got a mistress
Until you can show me im gon' stand by him
No matter what you say I ain't goin no where
No matter what you think ima always be there
The love that we share it lives inside of me
No matter what your fearin its all in the past
No matter what your feelin this love is gon' last
The heart and the soul it breathes inside of me
My man (he makes me feel so special)
My Man (he makes me feel so precious)
My Man (he makes me feel wonderful)
My Man (im feelin so comfortable)
My man (he makes me feel so special)

B-E-A-U-T-Y-E, never seen so much rage from a queen
Rage from a queen, queen so strong, thought she was a machine
Girl of your dreams, Synclaire, Regine
Turned to the max, can't forget Maxine
Refer to me as a goddess, I'm tired of being modest
A hundred degrees, the hottest, if we being honest
Ebony and ebonics, black people win
They say we bein' demonic, angel in disguise
I hate I have to disguise it, why you gotta despise it?
Rich in the mind, that's why I'm making deposits
Carry all the power, it's time to realize it

They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow

This that rhythm, this that lightning
This that burn, this ain't no perm
This that nappy, this that herb
This that kinfolk, this that skinfolk
This that war, this that bloodline
On the frontline, ready for war
Where you gon' run?
I'ma get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh yeah, get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh-oh-oh, gotta protect my grace
Keep it locked in the safe
Don't make me get back to my ways

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
Will you ride around with that H-town?
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

No, no, no, no, no, no...
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there
This is just another day that I would spend waitin' for the right one
Staring at the night, and wishin' I could be the one to feel the warm sun...
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake;
I'm in Heaven, for Heaven's sake...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...
Tell me that you're living in a place where no one else can find you;
Tell me that you're singing out my name, hoping that I'll hear you...
Tell me "no", and I'll fade away
But this is lovin' that I won't waste...
So get ready (get ready), I'm ready now (get ready);
I could never need you more than now...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...
"What are the words I'm needin' to hear?"
"How do I know if I'll ever love again?"
Seeing your face makes everything clear... (clear...) clear
And I'll never be the same...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
Hold on to you tight, for once in my life...
You were worth the waiting for
You, the one that I adore...
This kind of love, you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime...
Haaaa
(Come on baby)
Haaaa
(One night)
Haaaa
(One night only)
You want all my love and my devotion
You want my loving soul right on the line
I had no doubt that I could love you forever
The only trouble is I really don't have the time
I've got one night only
One night only
That's all I have to spare
One night only
Let's not pretend you care
I've got one night only
One night only
Come on, we better come on
One night only
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn)
We only have 'til dawn
(We only have 'til dawn!)
One night only
One night only
One night only (Oh)
One night only (Yeah-yeah)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
You and I will be running out of time!
Whoo yeah (Come on, come on)
Whoo, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, yeah (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
One night only (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on!
If the storm comes
If we burn up
If the wells run dry
You're my reason
To believe in
Another life
If it all ends
And it's over
If the sky falls fire
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side
If we wake up
Lose our patience
Or even lose our lives, oh
I'll feel lucky
To say that you've been
A friend of mine
Best believe me
You will see me
On the other side

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oir
Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre
Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre
Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós
Oye
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo asi
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy me ire sin ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz!
Who wants that perfect love story any way, anyway

Black hour glass, hour glass
Toast to cliché is in a dark past
Toast to cliché is in a dark past

Baby, long as I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out
The best in you
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, no
I know it's crazy but
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill

As a Black woman, I used to feel like the world wanted me to stay in my little box. And Black women often feel underestimated. And I wanted us to be proud of not only the show, but the process. Be proud of the struggle. Thankful for the beauty that comes with a painful history and rejoice in the pain. Rejoice in the imperfections and the wrongs that are so damn right. And I wanted everyone to be grateful for their curves, their sass, their honesty. Thankful for their freedom
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh

Music knocking till the morning light
Cause we like to party
We out in Abu Dhabi, we like to party
We don’t cause trouble, we just ride Bugatti
Bad chick shawty, sorta resemble Sade
Imported her in from Raleigh
And pulled up into the valet
The boy dropped the keys tryna sneak-a-peek at that body
See this that time of the week, she like to freek-a-leak and get naughty
Therefore I like to thank God and Ice Cube for Friday

You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce you dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got that swag sauce she dripping swagu, ooh
You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
You ain't right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
Baby
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
It’s just not my body (No)
It’s my mind, you don’t know
How many times I told myself
This can't do (Can't do)
And that I don’t need you (No, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair that I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(There, there)
You're no good for my health (My health)
You’re just like poison (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
Baby, kiss me one more time
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do, it’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you, I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me
What are you doing, my love?
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' you catch me
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb
Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
What are you doing my love?
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well my aspiration in life would be... to be happy
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful girl
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)
If tomorrow all the things were gone
Id worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side
Id thank my lucky stars, to be livin' here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, to New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time to make a change
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
And who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted to one time to see you laughing
I only wanted to see you
Laughing in the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain
Honey, I know, I know
I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out
For something new, that means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted to see you
Bathing in the purple rain
I be on the hotline, like e'rryday
Makin' sure the DJ know what I want him to play
You know I got my top back and my beat low
Rockin' my stunna shades and turnin' up my radio
Turn up my radio, radio, radio....
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Whenever I hear that sound

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room
With the door closed, we'd be alone
And mama never freaked out when she heard it go 'BOOM!'
'Cause she knew we were in the zone
Hold him in my arms and look out of my window
(Under the moonlight)
And he be keepin' me calm so I'd never let him go
He's got a place in my heart
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down

Whenever I hear that sound
When I get into my car, turn it uh-up, uh-up
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-unk, uh-unk
And the bassline be rattlin' through my see-eat, ee-eats
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing- i-ing, OH!
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (Playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays
He's got a place in my heart
I think I'm in love with my radio
'Cause it never lets me down
And I fall in love with my stereo
Whenever I hear that sound
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply to the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy, once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can
And I tried, and I tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good
Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another, more than my own life
But that part of me I gave you, it was sacrificed
And it's all because you lied
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm too damn full of resentment
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinking, "What's up with B?"
I been crying for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes and see she's had half of me
How could you lie?
ORIGINAL LYRICS:
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good / Like I couldn't do it for you like your mistress could
NEW LYRICS:
I'll always remember feeling like I was no good / Like I couldn't do it for you like that wack bitch could
Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, "I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart"
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl you so fine, put your love on top
If you're going through it, just know it's called "going THROUGH it"
You're not gonna get stuck there, you're not gonna die
You're gonna survive

Some people try to drag you down
Take it from me, stand and be proud
You're a warrior
You're my warrior

Rise up little man rise up little man
Fight for you and me
Look into my eyes and believe
Little woman we will fight, we will fight
Little woman we will fight, we will rise
I see you and me
Take my hand and we
We will stand we will fight, we will fight
We will stand and together we will rise
They'll burn you at the stake if you
Don't act like they want you to
But baby be yourself
Do good and help the world
Rise up, rise up little man
Don't be scared I'm holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get
Rise up, rise up little woman
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get, I will
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I
If I wrote a book about were we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life With Superman." That's how you make me feel
I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same
I see it everyday in all the things you do
In all the things you say
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh Oh Oh I
If I were to try to count the ways to make me smile
I'd run out of fingers before i run out of timeless
Things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my loving strong
Make me wanna try my best to give you what you want
And what you need
Give you my whole heart
Not just a little piece
More than a minimum, I'm talking everything
More than a single wish  I'm talking every dream
You are my rock, baby you're the truth
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
You are my rock, you're everything i need
You are my rock, so baby rock with me
I wanna kiss you, feel you, please you just fine
I wanna touch you, love you, baby all night
Reward you for all the things you do.`
You are my rock, I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
If there's options, i don't want them. They're not worth
My time cause if it's not you, oh no thank you. I like us
Just fine. You're a rock in a sand, you're a smile in a
Cry, you're my joy through the pain, you're the truth
Through the lies. No matter what i do, i know that i can
Count on you
Oh Oh Oh I, Oh Oh Oh I
Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, babe, over me
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Rock it 'til waterfalls
Bathe in these waterfalls
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls
And rock right up to, the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, your deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me babe, over me
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
Driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gonna do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, ride me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good that it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments
But for the attention of men
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes

Boy, I'm - I'm on your runway
And I don't never wanna come back
Put my name on your T-shirt
Put me on your map
....
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe
Satellites flashing by
Satellites
I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name
Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say)
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh, ok" (Uh-huh, ok)
Could it be that you at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
Baby why, why you gots to lie?
I'm all up in your game, boy, you better say my name, boy
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
('Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who, oh
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
If no one is around you, say "baby, I love you"
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (Say my name)
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby (Hey, yeah)
Why the sudden change? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you ain't runnin' game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say my name, say my name (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You actin' kinda shady (Hey, yeah) ain't callin' me baby (Alright)

I'm in this fight and I'm swinging, and my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness, but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand and I can barely stand
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely
I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you would stretch your hand looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head
Mom and dad, tried hide the world
Said the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad, tried hide the boys
I swear, that just make 'em want me more
At 14, they asked what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I can get me a drink"
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
This is for them pretty somethings
Living in a fastlane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party till the fire marshall's shut this sucker down
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
Yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey
I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time
I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening
I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today
There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things
I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel
My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message
I always loved you
Even though you did me wrong
I always stayed by your side
I guess I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one above you
I swear
Cheated on me now she's there
She won't answer your calls
Don't wanna be bothered at all
I guess I'll be the one standing with open arms
Sucker for love
Kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you
I can never leave you
No matter how hard I try
You'll probably do it again
I'll still be right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain
Sucker for love
Your kisses too
Your touch, I'm crazy for you
Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool
I'll still
Settle for you
I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you
Baby, yea
Look what you've done to me
I'm losing my mind
You've got the best of me
And it feels so right
You've got a way you work me
It's workin me I

In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?
I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini

Si yo fuera un chico
Sólo por una vez
Yo me vestiría como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
Saldría a buscar
Chicas por montón
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompañarme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir
Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de un molde
Y nosotras somos de corazón
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Nos vence nuestra seducción
Si yo fuera un chico
Sé que podría saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
Sabría escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tú, ya no está más
Pero eres un chico
Que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasó
Pero eres un chico

I grew up in Houston, Texas visiting Prairie View. We rehearsed at TSU for many years in Third Ward. And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU. My college was Destiny's Child. My college was traveling around the world and life was my teacher. I wanted a Black orchestra. I wanted the steppers. I needed the vocalists. 'Cause I wanted different characters—I didn't want us all doing the same thing. And the amount of swag is just limitless, like...  the things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play and the drumrolls and the haircuts and the bodies and the... it's just not right. It's just so much damn swag

Tell him, boy, bye (Bye), boy, bye (Bye)
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair
Let me hear you sing
Sorry, I ain't sorry

And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got...
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it
(Me, myself, and I) Sing it
(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) Found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) Sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Right, ladies? Yes

I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life
I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well, I won't
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life
I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us
Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life
As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family

Touching you
Loving you
I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching
I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you, oh
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you
I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh
I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby
We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves together
And I love you
More than music
Yes, I love you more than music
I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Kissing you
I like to feel so high and
You feel good feeling low
I like my colors vivid
And you paint your colors gold
I like to see the world
And you like your weekends home
But I've been staying behind
While you refused to go
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch tv all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me
And doing the same
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lose you honey
I even slowed down thought you'd follow
But you took your own roads honey
Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
Only to find that
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind
While you refused to go
Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight up off my shoulders
Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow
Together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign
Chorus
It's funny how things turn around
Last night you tryna get down you act like you down
Any other time it's like you steady hatin on Brown
I'm tryna see my name in lights you tryna short  out the ground
You're the one that's got it twisted cause I'm right by your side
I had a bad day you jumpin' on my back for a ride
What can a man say I'm on the run, just for your auditionin
Callin on you every night it's like you never listenin
You're the one that's switchin up gettin to specifics
When you say that I'm just dreamin I be rollin like a Michelin
Carmen you just trippin cause you know I love you infinite
Just so we could be here look at everything I did for this
So why you actin like that
You don't have to take it anymore fight back
I came to far to turn around and just hike back
Trying to get me sidetracked see me on the corner where the sign of the time
At
Chorus x2
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos
Trying to be a star and now you messin up my cosmos
But you can't find something if you walkin' wit a blindfold
Carmen I can see right through you with my eyes closed
Songs you got me singin like my name was Bobbly Blubland
Don't make me sing 'em cause the game you playin baby two can

There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Hey yo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let' s go
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime (ohh)
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill a house with ya pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family
I wanted more then just a man
I needed a friend
You are my best friend (yeah)
Someone I could talk to
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin
Yo let me holla at you for a sec
So what's in gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And bare boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit
Livin the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries you ain't gotta be stressed out
No hurries you ain't gotta be rushed out
Sit back relax ma take your time
Now have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me
And in your heart you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially
Love who you is girl, you bring out the best of me
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's your plan, where's your hand let me ice that
You my heart ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot baby take that, take that
Yeah..

When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
(Turn the lights on)
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere

Svake noci pozurim u krevet
Sklopim oci,ludim,izgubljena u bajci
Mozes li me drzati za ruku i biti moj vodic?
Oblaci ispunjeni zvezdama prekrijte nebo
I nadam se da ce pasti kisa
Ti si savrsena uspavanka..kakaw ce owo biti san?
Mozes biti slatki san,ili prelepa nocna mora
Kako god,ne zelim da se probudim..
Slatki san,ili nocna mora? Svejedno,ne zelim da se probudim..
Pominjem te u mojim molitvama
Uvijem te u sve svoje misli
Decko ti si moja povremena visina
Zelim da si tu kada se probudim
Pa me zagli svojim rukama u stvarnosti
I kazi da si na mojoj strani..
Oblaci ispunjeni zvezdama prekrijte nebo
I nadam se da ce pasti kisa
Ti si savrsena uspavanka..kakaw ce owo biti san?
Mozes biti slatki san,ili prelepa nocna mora
Kako god,ne zelim da se probudim..
Slatki san,ili nocna mora? Svejedno,ne zelim da se probudim
Istetovirala sam tvoje ime na mom srcu
Da bi ostalo..
Ni smrt nas ne moze rastaviti...Oblaci ispunjeni zvezdama prekrijte nebo
I nadam se da ce pasti kisa
Ti si savrsena uspavanka..kakaw ce owo biti san?
Mozes biti slatki san,ili prelepa nocna mora
Kako god,ne zelim da se probudim..
Slatki san,ili nocna mora? Svejedno,ne zelim da se probudim

They say "Stay away from them gangstas"
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like
For instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Baby, that's why you're beautiful
I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."
Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?
Don't ask me why
The sky's blue; that's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."
Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you
That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
Ooh
Why, why?
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (Tell me more)
Your love has captured me
Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real (Ooh)
The way you make me feel
Lyin' here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more, more and more (More and more)
Let's give love a try (Let's give love a try)
Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way
Oh, ooh, oh, ooh, the closer I get (The closer I get)
Closer I get to you, baby
The more you make me see (The more you make me see)
More you make me see
By givin' me what you got, ohh yeah

(Come closer, love)

Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
Cuz I wanna tell you something

You know you really, really, really, really
Want to be with me
So why don't you stop beating around the bush
And come and give it to me
Derek we can make beautiful music together
If you only stop resisting the only woman that you really want
And its not wifey
Hey! You're real social
I don't like the way you're looking
Don't get too close
I'm about to take you down to booking
C'mon and touch me D I know you want to
Look, I only need your prints
Don't really care about your frontal
I don't see me living another day
Without your tender kisses
Why don't we retire to the room
Put on some Luther, light some incents
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
You trying to act like I'm not a cop
You can bring the cuffs, if you would like to
If that's your style
Looks let's get it straight, you cease and disist
I got some platinum bracelets
I'm about to squeeze on ya wrists
But you don't understand the way that I feel
The pain I could heal
I could lose my job for this
There is no way we could chill
So why you bring me this far
Now let's try to be real
Cause only time will reveal
If you still playing the field
Every second that you stay is like an hour we will
I got a couple days to kill
Either you down or you peel
I don't want anything without you in my life
You are my baby
Why don't you forget about your girl
And say you want me as your lady
Get to know one another just a little better
Than we do now
Give in to everything you're feeling that's surprising
Let's make love now
Nah, I don't think so
Your body is like weed smoke though
Light-headed, feel ya eyes saying please don't go
It ain't about getting locked
Cause it's your steeze I need
My heart don't lie, come over D and feel my beat
Oh no! Cause I can see your skin is soft
You know, but I dont wanna pay the cost to be with you
You can't deny your feelings for us
You know it's true
I gotta go, but really now I'm feeling you
I wanna do it, but I don't
You know, I'd feel your thigh, but I'm so full of decency
Go with your instincts and I'm sure it leads to me
There's only moments to see if it is to be...

Every breath is giving Him glory until my death (I feel blessed)
Cuz everyday I`m seeing Him work (I feel blessed)
I don`t wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It`s time to come home
It doesn`t matter where you been Or what you did wrong

Callin on all of God`s children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)

I be the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (hehe)
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me
Switch your neck ties to purple labels
Upgrade you, I can (up), can I (up) grade you?
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in ya necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond creamed facials
VVS cuff links, six-star pent suites
Partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me, upgrade ya, grade ya
Partna, partna, partna, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

'Cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'Til the sun comes down and rise
And come right back up again
You're the best thing that's happened in my life
When your absent in the borders is my life
And it just ain't right
So take as long as you like
I'm waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex

When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you
If your heart is in your dream, no request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star as dreamers do
Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me?
When I make me so damn easy to love
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me?
When I make me so damn easy to need
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain
Dumb
Oooh Oooooh
Oooh Oooh
On A star
And I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we can spend
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
Whether or never
I feel it's time we should make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never
And I'm wishin on a star
To follow where you are
And I'm wishing on a dream
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm
Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done
Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
Into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
To take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!
I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
You was on the wall
I was with my crew
You was watchin' me, baby
I was watchin' you
Slowly you walked over
I maintained my cool
You said hello to me
I said hello to you
You ask me where I'm from
I asked you what you do
You somehow intrigued me
I thought you were so cool
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
Certainly you can call me, baby
I love to hear from you
Yes, of course you can come and see me, boy
I want to get to know you more
I'm feelin' you
No, baby, not yet, we can't take that next step
Why you getting so upset?
Boy, you act as though I never told you yes before
You are so ungrateful, mmm, mmmm
You was at my house
I was sittin' on my couch
You was really buggin''
So I told you to get out
I had been misjudging you
You had a lotta nerve
You too damn old to be so immature
I hope you learn
You said I move too slow
I showed you to the door
You said you'd call me later
I said don't call no more
It's cool if you can't wait for me
I'm glad you let me know
'Cause you show me your true face, baby
The first time I said no
I said yes to your mama
And yes to you dating me
Yes, we can be together
But you gotta wait for me
The first time I say no
It's like I never said yes (It's like I never said yes)
I said yes, we can be together
Yes, you can stay with me
But when I say no not tonight
You actin' so ungratefully
The first time I say no

If you ask me, baby
I'll do anything you say you, boy
Oh, come here, come here!
I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it
Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown
You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible
I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know?
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist
You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life
