## Goals

Our goals are for students to become adept at independently sourcing necessary information
when facing Digital Humanities-related inquiries and to acquire an array of digital skills via hands-on tutorials. Through both theoretical understanding and critical reflection, students will engage deeply with the Digital Humanities. By the end of the course, students should be capable of:

    - Understanding the historical, theoretical, and methodological context of Digital Humanities as a field of study.
    - Applying a range of digital tools and approaches to address research questions in the humanities.
    - Assessing the impact and implications of digital technology on humanities disciplines.
    - Engaging critically with the ethical issues raised by digital projects in the humanities.
    - Developing and presenting a Digital Humanities project, demonstrating their understanding of the methodologies, tools, and theoretical perspectives studied in the course.
