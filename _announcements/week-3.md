Hi everyone --

I hope you’re all doing well! Just a quick note: unfortunately, I have to cancel tomorrow’s class. I tested positive for COVID on Saturday (though I’ve been largely asymptomatic). I’m feeling much better now, but my latest test still shows the faintest of red lines, so I think it’s best to take one more day to fully recover.

That said, you can use the time tomorrow to catch up on your reflections and annotations (and for those who already have them in, wonderful!). We’ll meet as planned on Thursday for our field trip to Special Collections. Please meet at Firestone Library, C-level at 11:00 AM. The pre-class materials are already posted on the course website—-there are no annotations or reflections required for Thursday’s class!

Thanks so much for your understanding (apologies for the short notice); I’ll keep you all posted if anything else changes!

Best --

Wouter
