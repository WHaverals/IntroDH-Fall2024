Hi all --
 
Sadly, **today’s (Feb. 13) class is CANCELED**. I just received the message that the Mudd Library will be closed for the day. I will message you all later today/tomorrow about the change of schedule (I’m hoping we can visit the Mudd Library on Thursday – but will keep you posted).

Stay safe and warm!
