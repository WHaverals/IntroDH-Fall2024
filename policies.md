# Course Policies and Expectations

## Reading

Almost every week, we will read key texts that touch upon important themes in digital humanities, highlight specific projects, or introduce a technique/methodology. Needless to say, these readings are crucial. They not only prepare you for the content of the lessons (and I will expect you to be familiar with them) but also set the stage for our discussions. All texts will be made available through the online platform [Perusall](https://www.perusall.com/), which enables collaborative reading. You will be able to annotate the texts and comment on each other’s annotations. I will also be able to see your annotations and comments, which will help me to prepare for our discussions.

## Class Meeting Types

Below goes an overview of the different types of class meetings we'll have. It is important to note that **discussions -- anchored by the readings -- will be part of every class meeting**, regardless of the type.

- **Discussion**{: .label .label-blue}: Sessions that combine lecturing with discussions, emphasizing critical engagement with the assigned materials.
- **Lab**{: .label .label-red}: Hands-on sessions that apply concepts in a practical setting.
- **Present**{: .label .label-green}: Sessions where students present their projects or research.
- **Field Trip**{: .label .label-yellow}: Visit to Princeton University Library's Special Collections and Makerspace.

## Attendance and Participation

Many sessions in this seminar will be discussion-based, where active participation is essential. Your responsibility includes **arriving on time, completing the readings and exercises, and being prepared for class discussions and activities**.

I understand that unavoidable situations can arise: sometimes life just happens. **If you must miss a class, please try to inform me in advance.** You’re allowed to miss up to three classes –- no questions asked. Additional absences may impact your grade, except in the case of medical or personal emergencies, religious holidays, or attending/traveling to/from varsity competitions.

## Slack

While our course takes place in person, we will use _Slack_ as an additional communication platform. It serves as a space for posting [reflections](https://introtodh-fall2024.slack.com/archives/C07JYA7QTM0) on the assigned materials, sharing [resources](https://introtodh-fall2024.slack.com/archives/C07KM0H9943) like files and links, and seeking [assistance](https://introtodh-fall2024.slack.com/archives/C07KM3PUMGA) with assignments outside of class hours. Make sure you join our _Slack_ workspace by using the invitation link provided in class!

## Office Hours

I'm available for office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00-2:00pm at the [Tiger Tea Room](https://dining.princeton.edu/where-eat/locations/tiger-tea-room). Office hours are a great chance for us to discuss anything related to the class – be it readings, assignments, feedback, challenging concepts. I'm also happy to chat about your interests in digital humanities, or to help you find resources for your research. If you can't make it to office hours, feel free to email me to set up an appointment.

## Class Etiquette

In order to create a productive and respectful learning environment, let's observe the following guidelines:

- Aim to thoughtfully contribute to our discussions at least once every class. If you find class participation intimidating or difficult for any reason, please discuss this with me during office hours early in the semester. Together, we can work on improving your participation skills and set achievable goals.

- Arrive on time and be ready to actively engage in class discussions and exercises.

- When presenting an argument or viewpoint, substantiate it with specific examples from our readings or discussions.

- When responding to a classmate, be respectful and constructive. If you disagree with their viewpoint, explain why and provide evidence to support your argument.

- If you often contribute, consider stepping back occasionally to let others speak.

- Address your classmates by their preferred names and be mindful not to make assumptions about gender pronouns.

- Given the digital nature of our course, it's important to create an environment with minimal distractions. During class -- whether in discussions, hands-on labs, group work, solo activities, or presentations -- please keep only relevant course material tabs open on your browser. Refrain from browsing social media, checking emails, or messaging during class to maintain focus.

## Health and Wellness

Your well-being is important. If you're experiencing challenges affecting your health -- be it physical, emotional, or mental -- Princeton University offers extensive support. The [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services) provides free counseling, group support, and more, all adhering to [strict confidentiality standards](https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services/counseling/confidentiality-cps).

## Equipment

Since many of our sessions involve hands-on work with digital tools, but also because assignments will require you to work with digital tools, **you will need a laptop** for this course (tablets, unfortunately, won't suffice). If you do not have one, please let me know as soon as possible. I will do my best to help you find a solution!

## Installation

Some of the tools we will use in this course require installation. I will provide detailed instructions for each tool ahead of our session. Please make sure to follow these instructions carefully and to **install the tools in advance of our session**. If you have any issues, please let me know.

## Conduct Research with Integrity

Plagiarism will not be tolerated. You are responsible for ensuring that your submitted work is original work. If you are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, please consult the [University of Princeton's Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities page](https://rrr.princeton.edu/2023/students-and-university/24-academic-regulations#comp246).

## AI Assistance

Intellectual honesty is crucial to an academic community and for my fair evaluation of your work. Yet we cannot ignore the fact that generative artificial inteligence -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs), such as CHatGPT -- are putting siginificant pressure on the way education is shaped today. I will ask you to engage with it in a reasonable and responsible manner that aligns with the Honor Code of Princeton University. In concrete and explicit terms, this means that **all work submitted in this course must be your own, completed in line with [Princeton University’s academic regulations](https://rrr.princeton.edu/2022/students-and-university/24-academic-regulations)**.

Simultaneously, I believe that conversing with a Large Language Model like ChatGPT is an important skill (and will be in the future). For certain assignments, I will explicitly instruct you to use ChatGPT as a discussion partner for brainstorming purposes (not for copying answers verbatim). This approach will help you to critically engage with the content and to develop your ability to analyze and synthesize information.

Using LLMs should be seen as an opportunity to enhance your learning and understanding, rather than a shortcut to completing assignments. It is a tool for exploration, providing a way to expand your thinking and challenge your perspectives. As with any educational tool, the key lies in how you use it to complement **your learning**.

## COVID Protocol

If you test positive for COVID, please stay home! Inform me, and we will arrange -- if possible -- a semi-hybrid option.
