title: Week 12 - Roles, Responsibilities, and the Future
---

In our concluding week, we will revisit the topics explored throughout the semester, reflecting on the ethical dimensions of Digital Humanities and considering critical issues such as algorithmic bias and transparency in the age of AI. This will help frame the ongoing and future work of (digital) humanities scholars. **The first session (Dec. 3) will be held remotely** and will feature a discussion-based format, providing an opportunity to wrap up the class, ask final questions, and look ahead. **For the second session (Dec. 5), there will be no live class**. Instead, you will submit and asynchronously review recorded work-in-progress presentations.

- **No live class** will be held for this session.
- **Instead, submit a 4~5 minute work-in-progress video presentation** detailing the current state of your final assignment. This is an opportunity to share ideas, express doubts, and gather feedback from your peers and instructor.
- **Consider addressing the following points in your presentation**  
  1. Narrative/research question/hypothesis/reasons why your project is important
  2. Dataset identification and collection/potential issues with the data (with or without solutions)
  3. DH methods/tools/frameworks that you are considering implementing
  4. Challenges you are facing
- **Submission guidelines**  
  - Videos must be uploaded to the designated folder (referenced on Slack, link coming soon!) by <a style="color: #ee6374;">11:59 PM on Dec 4</a>.  
  - Name your file as: `Lastname_Firstname_PresentationTitle.mov|mp4|...`.  
  - Keep your presentation within the 5-minute limit.  
  - You may use any recording software (e.g., Zoom, QuickTime).  
  - While optional, using slides or screen sharing to support your points is highly recommended.
- **Feedback expectations**  
  - Videos will be shared on *Perusall* for asynchronous peer feedback and discussion. Link will be shared here once all videos are collected! 
  - You are required to provide feedback on at least **two peer presentations** using a rubric that will be shared in advance.
  - Peer feedback is due by <a style="color: #ee6374;">11:59 PM on Dec 6</a>.
- **Once again...**
  -  The video presentation shows your **work-in-progress**, so it is 100% okay if you are still figuring out some of the specifics of your project! Use the opportunity to put forward questions/doubt and explore your ideas.
