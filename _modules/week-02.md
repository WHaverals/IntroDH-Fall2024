<!-- Look at one example of a digital humanities project and see if you can describe it in terms of the basic components of materials, processing, and presentation.

Ulysses Project: (developed by @frabbitry and team: a study of how James Joyce's Ulysses associated various locations in the city of Dublin with literary and mythic allusions. Creates a map as guide to parts of Dublin that are associated with passages in Ulysses.)

Banksy Project: (developed by @alnopa9 and team: a gallery and study of the works of the artist Banksy, where in the world they are distributed, and what media forms they have taken.)

The Hamilton Project: (Greensburg project with lots of network visualizations and a graph of motifs and their frequency of repetition in the musical Hamilton)

Profanities in Quentin Tarantino's Screenplays (Pittsburgh student project, with network analysis of offensive language spoken by/to male and female characters)

Divergences in Machine Translation: Examining Harry Potter texts processed by Google Translate across multiple language families: (Pittsburgh student project)

La Lega Toscana Protezione multi-semester Pitt/newtfire project by @zme1 studying English-Italian language adaptation and membership in a Pittsburgh Italian society, with a terrific range of graph types.

Write up a 500-word blog post about the project you chose, describing it in terms of the basic components of materials, processing, and presentation. What materials are used? How are they processed? How are they presented? What do you think is the most interesting aspect of the project? What do you think is the most challenging aspect of the project? What do you think is the most successful aspect of the project? What do you think is the least successful aspect of the project? What would you do differently if you were to do a similar project? -->
