title: Week 2 - Data Culture(s)
---

This week we survey the expansive terrain of Digital Humanities. First, we'll engage in a discussion on 'data' as a core concept, and the methodologies that propel the field forward. Later on this week, we focus on practical applications of metadata and data description.

<!--
- Pre-Class Exercise:
  - Play around with [Google's Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) to investigate two terms of your choice (e.g. 'car' vs. 'automobile'). Analyze and interpret the trends you observe. Consider the following: what intriguing patterns -- if any -- emerge? Can specific historical events explain shifts in the usage of these terms? You are welcome to do a quick online search to support your interpretations, but keep it concise -- no more than three sentences for each term.
  - **Post your analysis along with a screenshot of your NGram search in the** <a href="https://introtodh--spring2024.slack.com/archives/C06FSP0UUEQ" style="color: #ee6374;">**#ngrams** </a>**channel on Slack** <a style="color: #ee6374;">**before 9:00AM on the day of our class.**</a>
