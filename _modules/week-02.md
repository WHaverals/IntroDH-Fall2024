title: WEEK 2 - The Digital Transformation -- Imaging, Digitizing, and Understanding Data
---

Anyone who wants to conduct research within the Digital Humanities requires digital surrogates or representations of real, physical objects. In this module, we examine how data is created; what are the processes that take place, including the digitization of images and text. With permission from the Princeton University Library, we pay a visit to the service that is responsible for digitizing and processing the collection of manuscripts, and rare books that are part of the Princeton collection. We also reflect on tools that facilitate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) processes.
