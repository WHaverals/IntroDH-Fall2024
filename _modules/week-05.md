title: Week 5 - Text Digitization and Markup Languages
---

During our first session this week, we will look at  into the technology behind making text digitally readable. Our historic postcard collection provides the perfect case study for exploring both Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) technologies. In our subsequent session, we will explore the world of markup languages, such as HTML and XML. We will discuss their significance in structuring and presenting digital content, and explore how these languages serve as the backbone of content representation on the web.
