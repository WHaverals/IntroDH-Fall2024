title: Week 5 - Text Digitization (pt. II) and Distant Reading (pt. I)
---

During our first session this week, we will continue with our exploring of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. In the second session, we will shift our focus to Distant Reading, a method of analyzing large bodies of text to uncover patterns and trends that are not immediately apparent.

  <!-- - Explore [this demo of Edition Visualization (EVT)](http://evt.labcd.unipi.it/demo/evt_v1-3/dotr/index.html). Spend some time interacting with the interface and the features it offers (e.g., text-image synchronization, the diplomatic vs. interpretative views, and metadata features). Focus on how EVT makes the manuscript more accessible for scholarly research. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the digital interface? -->
