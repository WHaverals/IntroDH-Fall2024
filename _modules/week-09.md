title: Week 9 - Data Visualization and GIS
---
This module focuses on the visual dimension of Digital Humanities research. Often, the dissemination of results takes the form of graphs or they are displayed via graphical interfaces. We will explore a whole spectrum of data visualization practices, citing examples of the good, the bad, and even the downright ugly. In this sense, the session is aimed to prepare us for the coming labs on mapping and network analysis.

- Pre-Class Exercise:
  - Every year since 2012, the Digital Humanities community has recognized outstanding contributions through the [**Digital Humanities Awards** 🏆](http://dhawards.org/). On the award website, you'll find examples of data visualization that are not only stunning but also effective in conveying complex information. 
    1. **Explore** the [nominees from this year](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2023/voting/), or past years ([2012](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2012/nominations/), [2013](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2013/results/), [2014](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2014/voting/), [2015](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2015/voting/), [2016](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2016/voting/), [2017](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2017/voting/), [2018](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2018/voting/), [2019](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2019/voting/), [2020](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2020/voting/), [2021](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2021/voting/), [2022](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2022/voting/)). 
    2. **Choose a visualization** that resonates with you. 
    3. **Capture a screenshot** of this visualization and **add it to our session's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CZ1AQo9jAT7HKHvDnXSrSQPeqznO-GNt1W1BkbcSfOc/edit?usp=sharing)** (limit yourself to one slide; for interactive visualizations, include a link to allow us to explore the visualization in detail during class). 
    4. While a formal presentation isn't required, prepare to **discuss** the following in class: What is being depicted? In what ways is it presented? Why do you believe this visualization is impactful? Think about its strengths and any potential weaknesses.
