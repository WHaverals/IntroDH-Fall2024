title: Week 6 - Distant Reading
---

This week begins with a hands-on lab session where we will be leveraging the web-based [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), known for their user-friendly, powerful capabilities for visual text analysis. This module is designed to be both instructive and engaging, providing you with practical experience using digital tools to analyze large textual data sets. Drawing inspiration from the works of [El Khatib and Ross (2022)](https://doi.org/10.17613/42c8-mk80), we will conduct an ecological reading of Emily Brontë’s novel *Jane Eyre*, and an exploratory thematic analysis of Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein*.

- Slides (_coming soon!_)
  - On this day, students will present their Data Biographies. This is a chance to share the intriguing stories behind the datasets you've explored!
  - Each presentation should last approximately -- but also no more than -- **4 minutes**, followed by a brief (~1 minute) Q&A/feedback session.
  - Focus on the **narrative** of your Data Biography, presenting on aspects you find interesting, such as origin, collector(s), collection method(s), intended use, and any limitations or ethical considerations.
  - Use visuals or excerpts from your dataset to illustrate your points and engage the audience.
  - For more details, refer to the [assignment description](https://whaverals.github.io/IntroDH-Fall2024/assignments/#assignments).
  - Presentation guidelines:
    - Maximum of **five (5) slides** per presentation, and a very strict time limit of **four - *4!* - minutes**. You will be cut off if you exceed this limit!
    - Please add your slides to the shared slide deck (*link coming soon*) before the start of the class.
  - Order of presentations (*TBA*)
