title: Week 1 - Intro to and Foundations of Digital Humanities
---

In this module, we will take our time to become acquinted with the contours that delineate the field known as Digital Humanities. We discuss what are the essential or minimal ingredients (if there are any), and critically examine various definitions. We traverse the landscape of Digital Humanities and explore how early definitions of the field differ from more recent attempts at defining it.

- Pre-Class Reflection:
  - [Examine this website](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/), hit the _New Quote_-button a few times, and read the definition that appears. Some guiding questions:
    - How do the definitions you encounter vary each time you refresh the page? What does this diversity tell you about the nature of Digital Humanities as a field? What are the commonalities between the definitions? What are the differences? Consider the role technology plays in these definitions. Is it merely a tool, or does it fundamentally reshape the humanities?
