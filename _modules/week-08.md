title: Week 8 - Stylometry
---

In this module, we will discover the world of stylometry, a field that probes the unique stylistic fingerprint of authors. Utilizing the user-friendly package [Stylo](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-007/index.html), we will undertake a critical review and replication of Patrick Juola’s study (2013), which aimed to reveal the author hiding behind the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. In doing so, we will not only explore the power of stylometric techniques, but also discuss the broader implications of this type of research, emphasizing the ethical and scholarly consequences.

    > The readings listed below are part of this week's lab effort to replicate [Patrick Juola's analysis on the authorship of J.K. Rowling](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5315). It is however crucial to recognize that J.K. Rowling has become a figure of controversy owing to her remarks concerning the transgender community. The decision to include her work in our study does not equate to an endorsement of her opinions or a promotion of her work. Our goal is to undertake a computational examination of Rowling's writings, analyzing the stylistic distinctions between works published under her own name and those released under a pseudonym. The readings listed below are part of a broader discussion on the importance and challenges of addressing controversial creators and topics in Digital Humanities. I am curious about your insights. Can we separate our study of J.K. Rowling's authorship from her personal opinions, allowing the field of Digital Humanities to persist in its computational analysis of her work (and for me to continue incorporating this case in stylometry classes), or should we consider refraining from including her in our research altogether?
