title: Week 10 - 'Making' in DH and GIS
---
This module introduces the hands-on dimension of Digital Humanities research, focusing on how "making" is becoming an essential part of its practice. We'll explore the role of embodiment in research through activities like 3D printing, electronics, and other forms of physical creation. This will set the stage for our upcoming lab on GIS, by examining how physical and spatial perspectives can enhance DH projects.

<!-- - Pre-Class Exercise: -->
  <!-- - Every year since 2012, the Digital Humanities community has recognized outstanding contributions through the [**Digital Humanities Awards** 🏆](http://dhawards.org/). On the award website, you'll find examples of data visualization that are not only stunning but also effective in conveying complex information.  -->
    <!-- 1. **Explore** the [nominees from this year](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2023/voting/), or past years ([2012](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2012/nominations/), [2013](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2013/results/), [2014](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2014/voting/), [2015](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2015/voting/), [2016](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2016/voting/), [2017](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2017/voting/), [2018](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2018/voting/), [2019](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2019/voting/), [2020](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2020/voting/), [2021](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2021/voting/), [2022](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2022/voting/)).  -->
    <!-- 2. **Choose a visualization** that resonates with you.  -->
    <!-- 3. **Capture a screenshot** of this visualization and **add it to our session's [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CZ1AQo9jAT7HKHvDnXSrSQPeqznO-GNt1W1BkbcSfOc/edit?usp=sharing)** (limit yourself to one slide; for interactive visualizations, include a link to allow us to explore the visualization in detail during class).  -->
    <!-- 4. While a formal presentation isn't required, prepare to **discuss** the following in class: What is being depicted? In what ways is it presented? Why do you believe this visualization is impactful? Think about its strengths and any potential weaknesses. -->
