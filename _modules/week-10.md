title: Week 10 - Network Analysis and AI
---

This week, we continue our exploration of visualization in Digital Humanities with a focus on network analysis. Building on our discussion on data visualization, we'll look at web-based platforms like [_Flourish_](https://flourish.studio/) and software like [_Gephi_](https://gephi.org/) and learn how network analysis provides valuable insights into relational data. In the latter part of the week, we shift our attention to the rapidly advancing field of Artificial Intelligence and its growing influence on Digital Humanities. We confront these developments by analyzing their impacts, potential, and the conundrums they create.
