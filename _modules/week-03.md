title: Week 3 - A Project of Our Own
---

In this module, we will start on our class-crowdsourced project featuring a dataset that captures the essence of Princeton University: the Princeton University Historical Postcard Collection. Part of this collection has been digitized and is available through the [Princeton University Digital Library](https://dpul.princeton.edu/collections/7d278t50j). We will outline the various stages of this project, from conception to completion, and identify the tools and techniques that will assist us throughout. We will also pay a visit to the [Mudd Library](https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections) where we will view the collection up close. In the second meeting of this week, we investigate the critical procedures involved in data cleaning, and how [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) can be used in this process.

- Pre-Class Exercise:
  - [Explore the Princeton University Historical Postcard Collection](https://dpul.princeton.edu/historical-postcards) and select a postcard that you find interesting. Critically analyze it using **one** of the following guiding questions:

    1. If available, find the same postcard on a different online platform. Note differences in color, detail, or cropping. What do these variations suggest about digitizing analog materials?
    2. Assess the quality of the digital images. Are there details potentially lost or misrepresented in the digital version?
    3. Look at the metadata provided alongside the digital surrogate. How does this information affect your understanding of the postcard?
    4. Reflect on your experience navigating the digital collection. How does the digital interface impact your exploration and understanding?
    5. Hypothesize about how viewing the postcards digitally might differ from viewing them in person.
    6. What do you think the digitization process for this collection was like? What challenges might have been encountered? What choices were made?
