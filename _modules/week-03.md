title: Week 3 - A Project of Our Own
---

In this module, we will start on our class-crowdsourced project featuring a dataset that captures the essence of Princeton University: the Princeton University Historical Postcard Collection. Part of this collection has been digitized and is available through the [Princeton University Digital Library](https://dpul.princeton.edu/collections/7d278t50j). We will outline the various stages of this project, from conception to completion, and identify the tools and techniques that will assist us throughout. We will also pay a visit to the Princeton University's [Special Collections](https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections) where will take a tour of the Digitization Studio. In the second meeting of this week, we investigate the critical procedures involved in data cleaning, and how [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) can be used in this process.

  <!-- - Pre-Class Exercise: -->
    <!-- - [Explore the Princeton University Historical Postcard Collection](https://dpul.princeton.edu/historical-postcards) and select a postcard that you find interesting. Critically analyze it using **one** of the following guiding questions: -->

      <!-- 1. If available, find the same postcard on a different online platform. Note differences in color, detail, or cropping. What do these variations suggest about digitizing analog materials? -->
      <!-- 2. Assess the quality of the digital images. Are there details potentially lost or misrepresented in the digital version? -->
      <!-- 3. Look at the metadata provided alongside the digital surrogate. How does this information affect your understanding of the postcard? -->
      <!-- 4. Reflect on your experience navigating the digital collection. How does the digital interface impact your exploration and understanding? -->
      <!-- 5. Hypothesize about how viewing the postcards digitally might differ from viewing them in person. -->
      <!-- 6. What do you think the digitization process for this collection was like? What challenges might have been encountered? What choices were made? -->
