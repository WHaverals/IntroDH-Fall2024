title: Week 3 - From Artifacts to Data
---

In this module, we investigate the critical procedures involved in data creation and cleaning, and how [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) can be used in this process. In our second session, we will pay a visit to the Princeton University's [Special Collections](https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections) where will take a tour of the Digitization Studio.

- For this class, we'll meet at the **Firestone Library, C-level** ("the bunker") at 11:00AM.
- Pre-Class Activities (no Peruasll annotations, nor reflection required!):
  - Familiarize yourself with the [Princeton's Digital Repository](https://dpul.princeton.edu) to get a sense of the extent of Princeton University's digitized materials. Specifically, explore [The Infant’s Library](https://dpul.princeton.edu/cotsen/catalog/dc9019sd49x) from the Cotsen Children’s Library. Reflect on how the physical characteristics of this item - a miniature bookcase with books! - are represented digitally. Consider how well the digitization captures the physicality of the item.
  - Listen to [this podcast episode](https://pricelab.sas.upenn.edu/podcast/1/dream-lab-podcast-digital-surrogates), where Dot Porter (Curator of Digital Research Services at UPenn's Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies) is interviewed by Stewart Varner (Managing Director of the Price Lab at UPenn).
