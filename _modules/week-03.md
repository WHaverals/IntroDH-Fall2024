title: Week 3 - Molding and Modeling -- Shaping Data for Inquiry and Understanding
---

In this module, we investigate the critical procedures involved in cleaning and annotating data, thereby preparing it for in-depth analysis. These processes invariably entail the making of mindful decisions, aspects we will delve into during our class discussions. As we gear up for the hands-on tutorials, we also explore an integral component of data analysis: data modeling. We will demystify this process, its bearing on our data handling techniques, and what constitutes an effective data model.
