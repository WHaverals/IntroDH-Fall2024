title: Week 11 - Guest Lecture & Python for the Curious
---

In the first session this week, we welcome a guest discussion led by Paavo Van der Eecken (University of Antwerp), a visiting Fulbright scholar working in Digital Humanities. Paavo’s research focuses on the annotation of age, race, class, and gender in the illustrations of historical children’s literature. His talk will provide insights into how data-driven approaches intersect with the study of visual and cultural representation.

The second session will explore the role of coding in the humanities with a gentle introduction to Python, a programming language as approachable as it is powerful. Our session will provide a panoramic view of Python's syntax and its practical applications in Humanities research. Ultimately, the goal of this week is to get a taste of programming in Python, with fear being an exception that is not allowed to interrupt the process.

Or, stated in a Pythonic way:

```python
try:
    learn_python()
except Fear as obstacle:
    handle(obstacle)  # apply strategies to overcome fear
else:
    print('Congratulations on embracing coding literacy!')  # celebrate
```
