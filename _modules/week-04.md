title: Week 4 - Molding and Modeling Data
---

In this module, we investigate the critical procedures involved in annotating data, thereby preparing it for analysis. These processes invariably entail the making of mindful decisions. As we gear up for the hands-on tutorials, we also explore an integral component of data analysis: data modeling. We will demystify this process, its bearing on our data handling techniques, and what constitutes an effective data model. In the second meeting of this week, students will present their Data Biographies.

<!-- - Presentation overview: -->
  <!-- - On this day, students will present their Data Biographies. This is a chance to share the intriguing stories behind the datasets you've explored! -->
  <!-- - Each presentation should last approximately -- but also no more than -- **4 minutes**, followed by a brief (~1 minute) Q&A session. -->
  <!-- - Focus on the **narrative** of your Data Biography, presenting on aspects you find interesting, such as origin, collector(s), collection method(s), intended use, and any limitations or ethical considerations. -->
  <!-- - Use visuals or excerpts from your dataset to illustrate your points and engage the audience. -->
