title: Week 4 - Molding and Modeling Data
---

In this module, we investigate the critical procedures involved in data creation and cleaning, and how [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) can be used in this process. These processes invariably entail the making of mindful decisions. During our second session this week, we will look at the technology behind making text digitally readable.
