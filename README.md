# Introduction to Digital Humanities -- Fall Semester 2024

## Description

This course offers an introduction to and an overview of the ‘big tent’ that is called Digital Humanities, emphasizing the integration of computational and quantitative methods in the study of humanities, particularly in literary studies. The course covers a range of digital tools and approaches designed to organize, explore, understand, and narrate data-driven stories. Course topics will range from a critical reflection on the boundaries – or boundlessness? – of Digital Humanities research, to the creation and preservation of digital cultural artifacts, and their dissemination and visualization in research outputs. 

Theoretical and methodological aspects of this expansive field will be interspersed with the opportunity to interact with various digital tools and techniques through participation in several hands-on replication studies. Alongside these case studies, the course encourages critical examination of the wider implications of digital paradigms within the humanities. This incorporates considerations of how digital practices impact the organization of institutions, the evolution of heritage institutions, and the skillsets and training necessary for navigating the vast digital sea.
