## Datasets

There are some great datasets out there! In this course, we will encounter and play with some of the ones listed here below. It goes without saying that it is impossible for this list to be exhaustive. Look at it as a point of reference, but perhaps more so as a place of inspiration. Should you stumble upon a fascinating dataset or have one to recommend, please bring it to my attention so we can enrich our collection further.

One way to find datasets is to use a dedicated search engine like the [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Other places where datasets live are [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/dataset), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), and the [Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD)](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). The website [Humanities Data](https://humanitiesdata.com/resources) also offers a curated list of datasets.

In the spirit of John Donne's insight that ["No man is an island,"](https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island) the field of Digital Humanities thrives on collaborative curation of resources. With this in mind, here are some excellent compilations of datasets put together by other scholars:

- **Sierra Eckert** provides a [curated list for an earlier iteration of this course](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHFall2022/blob/main/_datasets/datasets.md), which is perfect for humanities-centric explorations.
- **Melanie Walsh** offers an extensive [compilation of datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/Datasets/Datasets.ipynb) that includes everything from Nobel Laureate data to Game of Thrones character networks.
